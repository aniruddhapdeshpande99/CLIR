{"text": "Tanushree Dutta kick-started the #MeToo movement in India and many people are thankful for this as it gave them the courage to share their heartbreaking stories of being harassed.\nWhile #MeToo India's chapter has come like a reckoning for many but actor Renuka Shahane thinks that there are still uncountable, unknown stories of women who have faced sexual harassment and abuse that are waiting to be heard.\nThe actor says she also has a story but she was not wronged by someone famous. Talking to PTI, Renuka said,\nAgencies\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single woman who does not have a #MeToo story. My story does not involve anyone famous. It happened a long time ago but it impacted me for the longest time. It has colored how I view things. I have spent my entire life traveling in local trains and buses. You are constantly aware that you will get pinched, your breast will be pressed and so on. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re underage, married or pregnant. It\u2019s a never-ending list.\"\nThe actor, who unfailingly voices her opinions on important issues on social media, was recently announced as a member of an advisory committee by CINTAA (Cine And TV Artistes\u2019 Association) to tackle sexual harassment in the industry, where the movement first began with Tanushree Dutta reiterating her decade-old harassment story against Nana Patekar.\nAgencies\nDon't Miss 837 SHARES 3.6 K SHARES 193 SHARES\nAfter Nana Patekar, there have been several people who have been called out for their sexual misconduct and this long list includes Alok Nath, Sajid Khan, Subhash Ghai, Kailash Kher and Rajat Kapoor being accused of sexual harassment and in some cases of rape.\nShahane, 53, says she did not face any sexual harassment in the industry but \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of luck\u201d.\n\u201cThere have been propositions but when I refused the people respected my decision, so there\u2019s that.\u201d\nNath\u2019s misbehavior was one of industry\u2019s worst-kept secret, Shahane says, corroborating accounts of Sandhya Mridul, Himani Shivpuri and Deepika Amin. She adds it was years after she worked with the actor in Rajshri Productions\u2019 Hum Aapke Hain Koun! and DD show Imtihaan that she got to know about Nath\u2019s alleged behavior when magazines splashed the news of Tara star Navneet Nishan slapping him.\nTara writer-producer Vinta Nanda has accused Nath of sexual harassment and rape from almost two decades ago.\nAgencies\n\u201cEveryone knew that once he downed a drink, he would become another person. When I read Sandhya Mridul\u2019s account, I thought at least he admitted it to her. But we see over the years, the behavior just went on and on. I was not a party person, perhaps that\u2019s why I never experienced anything with him,\u201d she says, adding Rajshri always maintained strict discipline on its film sets.\n\u201cEverybody behaves in a very different way on a Rajshri set,\u201d she says.\nSome sections of the society have branded #MeToo as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d or \u201cpublic lynching\u201d with even innocent men\u2019s reputation being torched on social media. Shahane strongly disagrees, saying nobody wants an innocent person behind the bars but the movement has come into existence because the legal route is long and tedious. She adds,\n\u201cThe burden to prove the truth is heavy. That\u2019s why the movement has been important because at least they are being named and shamed. Yes, there will be some posts that will be shared out of revenge but most of the people who have been named and shamed like MJ Akbar and Alok Nath have been known to be serial offenders for years. These people have made life miserable for women for years altogether. I don\u2019t see it as lynching. They are moving court for defamation cases. Women are standing up. If they were not sure of such accusations, they would not be standing up.\"\nShahane is happy that industry bodies such as CINTAA, Indian Film & Television Directors\u2019 Association, and Screen Writers\u2019 Association and Producers Guild of India are taking steps to ensure a safe working environment for women in showbiz. The actor says now the people who have faced sexual harassment in the industry will have a place to go to where they can be heard.\n\u201cAll these associations have taken a very positive and strong reaction on the issue. CINTAA has taken it seriously from day one. I\u2019m really happy that men like Sushant Singh and Amit Behl have stood up and decided that \u2018enough is enough\u2019. It is important to understand that it is not a women\u2019s movement, it\u2019s a human movement. Irrespective of the gender, we all have to work together. Sexual harassment has no place in the workplace and it has to be done away with. It can\u2019t be a rule rather than being an exception. That so many people knew about it and did nothing, now that cannot be acceptable,\u201d she says.\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "Renuka Shahane Explains How Her #MeToo Story Continues To Haunt Her Till Today", "date_publish": "19/10/2018, 11:19:54", "description": "Renuka Shahane: Don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single woman who does not have a #MeToo story Renuka Shahane will be a member of the sexual harassment committee formed by CINTAA.
