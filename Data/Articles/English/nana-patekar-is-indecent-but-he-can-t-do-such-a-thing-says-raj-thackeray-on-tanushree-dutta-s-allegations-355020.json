He does crazy things but I don't think he can do such a thing. Court will look into it. What is the media to do with it? #MeToo is a serious matter, the debate over it on Twitter isn't right,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the court will look into the matter and that people on social media should stop discussing it arriving at a conclusion.\nreuters\nFurthermore, he said that women should raise their voice about such incidents but not after 10 years.\n\u201cIt seems it is being done to divert attention from petrol price, rupee value, and unemployment. If anything like #MeToo happens, women can come to MNS. We will teach a lesson to accused. Women must raise the voice when they face oppression, not after 10 years.\u201d\nAlso Read: Tanushree Feels People\u2019s Mindset Needs To Change, Says Today's Eve-Teaser Is Tomorrow's Rapist\nWith inputs from ANI", "title": "Nana Patekar Is Indecent But He Can\u2019t Do Such A Thing, Says Raj Thackeray On Tanushree Dutta\u2019s Allegations", "date_publish": "18/10/2018, 14:14:17", "description": "When Tanushree Dutta had accused Nana Patekar of sexual harassment on the sets of 2008 film Horn Ok Pleasss, she said that everyone knew about it but nobody took a stand for her.
