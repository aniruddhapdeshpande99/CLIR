{"text": "Varun Dhawan is one of the most successful stars of Bollywood. From just another \u201cstar kid\u201d, he is now one of the most bankable stars of Bollywood. In his career spanning over seven years, the actor has given zero flops.\nActor Varun Dhawan on Sunday said that there was a time when he was leaning towards gritty cinema and would have done anything in his power to be launched by Anurag Kashyap. The actor was speaking at an in-conversation session \"Dha-One\", moderated by writer Rumi Jaffery, with his father, filmmaker David Dhawan, at the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here. His Badlapur director Sriram Raghavan and IFFI Indian Panorama chairperson Rahul Rawail were part of the audience.\n\"Initially my leaning was always towards the left side. I had loved 'Black Friday', Sriram's films... I was leaning over there. I would have probably given my right hand at that time to be launched by Anurag Kashyap. Honestly,\" Varun said. To this David said, \"Thank God\".\nVarun said when he told his father that he was doing Badlapur, the veteran filmmaker received the news negatively.\nDavid added, \"I saw he had grown a beard for the character, he didn't used to laugh, he didn't use to talk for 20 days. So I asked my wife 'when will he cut his beard?' I didn't know what he was doing. But thought, 'chalo, achhi hee banegi' I saw the film. Sriram showed me twice and I loved the film. I said 'it's a revenge story, it's a Hindustani (Indian) film'.\"\nBCCL\nDon't Miss 583 SHARES 763 SHARES 207 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES\nVarun also revealed he had visited a psychiatrist for a couple of sessions after working on the emotionally disturbing Badlapur. When the revelation was met by both horror and laughs from the audience, the actor gave a nod to mental health awareness.\nHe said, There's nothing wrong in that, to speak your mind. Whatever that's inside you, it just gets balanced. They didn't say that 'there's something'... don't get scared. Nothing went wrong with me. But the doctor said, 'If you'll stay in an intense environment for a long time, so it will happen.\"\nThe actor said he realised that David is a known name in the film industry after the watchman of their building told him \"your father is a big director\".\nRecounting his childhood dream, Varun said he wanted to own a channel where he would have his own talk show \"where I would be able to do stand-up comedy and entertainment\".\nBCCL\n\"I was obsessed with Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Govinda and Mehmood... All those people who used to do improv comedy. I used to think 'these people are so talented'. And I also used to find such characters not only on the screen but also in real life. There was always used to be a person in the group who used to be the 'jaan' of the group, who does the comedy. The one who used to be the joker, the comedian. I always wanted to be that person,\" he said.\nThe actor, whose last release was Shoojit Sircar's October, said he also gave a shot to doing a day-job at CitiBank. Later he auditioned for Kiran Rao's Dhobi Ghat and David got upset after he came to know about it.\nThe filmmaker recalled saying, \"'You are mad or what you're going to do this 'Dhobi Ghat'? I told his mother that 'if he wants to do films, he should do it properly. He can't start it (career) with this kind of film.\"\nTwitter\nBut David was relieved when Karan Johar told him that Varun will be the hero in his next, Student of the Year.\n\"I said, 'What more can you ask for?' And he never asked me to make a film for him. When Karan said I'm directing the film, I said (to Varun), 'Now you just put your feet on his shoulders and jump',\" he said.\nVarun said he was not scared for his big debut as he thought if anything goes south, \"bill to Karan Johar pe phatega\" (\"it will be on Karan's head)\". He, however, added that he was most stressed while shooting for his father's \"Main Tera Hero\", his second film.\n\"Working with papa was the toughest. I used to be bullied there. He treated me very badly on the sets. I even cried on the day two of the shoot in my van. My brother came and laughed at me. He said, 'Papa has worked with tough actors like Sanjay Dutt, Salman Khan and Ajay Devgn. Don't think he'll treat you any different',\" the actor said.\nVarun said after the \"bright and happy\" Main Tera Hero, working in dark thriller \"Badlapur\" was a major gearshift for him.\n\"So when I left the sets of 'Main Tera Hero', directors used to ask me to take it easy. Sriram asked me to calm down as I had really overdone the film's death scene at the hospital such that the real patients in the wards nearby had woken up wondering what was happening,\" he said.\nBCCL\nThe actor, whose next will be the drama Kalank, said every film is a \"make or break\" opportunity for him.\n\"I want to do all kinds of cinema. I always function in extremes either happy or sad. So as I have done mostly happy films recently, I would soon want to do one in the other space,\" said while looking at Raghavan in the audience.\nHe earlier said he wore spectacles for the event to inspire the director to imagine a character for him once again - probably a negative one.\nVarun said he went for diverse projects like Badlapur and Badrinath ki Dulhania among others as he could see the \"hunger\" in the eyes of the directors who wanted to prove a point.\nWhen asked which actor he wants to emulate, he simply replied, \"I want to be Varun Dhawan.\"\nWith inputs from PTI", "title": "From Visiting A Psychiatrist Post Badlapur To Wanting A Debut With Anurag Kashyap, Varun Dhawan Bares It All", "date_publish": "26/11/2018, 15:27:54", "description": "Actor Varun Dhawan on Sunday said that there was a time when he was leaning towards gritty cinema and would have done anything in his power to be launched by Anurag Kashyap.
