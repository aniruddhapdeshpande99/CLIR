{"text": "After Filing Rape Case Against Alok Nath, Vinta Nanda Says Onus Is On Her To Prove Her Story\nAfter Filing Rape Case Against Alok Nath, Vinta Nanda Says Onus Is On Her To Prove Her Story\nWhen the #MeToo movement had hit India, particularly Bollywood, a lot of people asked why these women are speaking up now \u2013 after so many years. It obviously takes a lot of courage to come out, name and shame the sexual predators, especially when the society you live in is still fighting with misogyny and gender inequality.\nAnother reason why it took so much time is the aftermath of speaking up.\nWriter-producer Vinta Nanda was one amongst those who shared their stories on social media. She didn\u2019t name the predator; she hinted he is the \u201cmost Sanskari man\u201d in Bollywood. That was enough for people to comprehend who she was talking about -- Alok Nath, with whom she worked on the show called Tara, at that time.\nShe took her fight forward by filing an FIR against him. Now, that a rape case has been registered, she says that the onus is back on her.\n\u201cI had filed a police complaint. It took three weeks for them to call me back and say yes we will now file an FIR, which happened last week. Along with the filing of the FIR, which normally should've led to him being arrested or at least being investigated, now the onus is back on me.\u201d\nDon't Miss 653 SHARES 727 SHARES 8.5 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\n\u201cI have to go for a physical medical test now, twenty years later. I read in the paper today where they've said I have to undergo a medical check and only then they will be able to proceed with the case,\u201d she added.\nVinta Nanda filed her case on October 19. Following which, Alok Nath was booked under Indian Penal Code's Section 376 (rape).", "title": "After Filing Rape Case Against Alok Nath, Vinta Nanda Says Onus Is On Her To Prove Her Story", "date_publish": "26/11/2018, 12:16:29", "description": "Writer-producer Vinta Nanda was one among those who shared their #MeToo stories.
