Here's What Happened!\nMumbai Police is known for their fantastic team of officers who give their blood and sweat for the safety of the nation. But that's not the only thing they're good at. The social media of Mumbai Police is equally cool.\nSonam Kapoor recently posted a video of Dulquer Salmaan using a mobile phone while driving, and it seems like Mumbai Police did not take it lightly.\nDulquer Salmaan, an established actor of the Malayalam Cinema, will be next seen opposite Sonam in the film 'Zoya Factor'. Taking to her Instagram stories, Sonam Kapoor posted a video in which her co-actor can be seen driving a car with both his hands busy on his phone, instead of the steering wheel.\nSitting next to him, Sonam can be heard saying \"Weirdo.\" Shortly after the clip was posted, Mumbai Police took to their twitter handle to give a piece of advice to the two.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nWe agree with you @sonamakapoor ! Quite a \u2018weirdo\u2019 to try such stunts while driving and putting the lives of fellow drivers at risk too! We don\u2019t quite approve of these even in \u2018reel\u2019 life. #NotDone pic.twitter.com/WWoDz16hKj \u2014 Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) December 14, 2018\n\"We agree with you @sonamakapoor! Quite a 'weirdo' to try such stunts while driving and putting the lives of fellow drivers at risk too! We don't quite approve of these even in 'reel' life. #NotDone,\" the tweet read.\nHowever, Sonam quickly came to Dulquer's rescue and clarified that contrary to what the Mumbai police interpreted, that the actor was not driving the car, in fact, they were \"rigged on a truck\".\n\"We weren't driving we were rigged on a truck.. but I'm glad you guys are concerned.. I hope and I know you show the same interest in regular folk as well! Thanks for taking care!\" she tweeted.\nDulquer Salmaan also responded saying he's not a weirdo.\nWould appreciate it if you had checked some facts before tweeting this. In fact @MumbaiPolice helped us with permissions and traffic management during the shoot and were present the whole time. In my next tweet attaching the video I was shooting. #notawierdo https://t.co/WnKSnSDmjZ \u2014 dulquer salmaan (@dulQuer) December 14, 2018\nBut Mumbai Police did not stop there. They had a reply for Sonam Kapoor who called out to the regular folks.\nFor us, No Mumbaikar is \u2018regular\u2019 they are all \u2018special\u2019! And we are equally concerned about them all. Glad to know your safety wasn\u2019t \u2018rigged\u2019. @sonamakapoor https://t.co/PyYbB23OZs \u2014 Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) December 14, 2018\nDespite wrongly schooling Sonam Kapoor and Dulquer Salmaan, Mumbai Police still knows how to win the internet with their coolest comebacks.\nI like the people / person behind the sarcasm and the wit of the @MumbaiPolice twitter handle. Thank You for the safety. \u2014 Kubbra Sait (@KubbraSait) December 14, 2018\nProud of mumbai police \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Wacky (@khanwacky) December 14, 2018\nOops!!!
