{"text": "When Tanushree Dutta had levied sexual harassment allegations against Nana Patekar, Sonam Kapoor was one among the few Bollywood stars who said that they believed her.\nI believe #TanushreeDatta and @janiceseq85 recollection of the account. Janice is my friend, and she is anything but an exaggerator or a liar. And it\u2019s upto us to stand together. https://t.co/sF3mS5o1P8 \u2014 Sonam K Ahuja (@sonamakapoor) September 28, 2018\nNot long ago, Rajkumar Hirani was accused of sexual harassment by a woman who worked with him on his 2018 movie Sanju. It was apparently the first time that a Bollywood A-lister was accused of #MeToo. Bollywood stars kept mum on this except a few including Arshad Warsi, Sharman Joshi and Raageshwari among others.\nSonam Kapoor who is busy promoting her movie Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, which has been released today, was asked about the same in one of the interviews.\n\u201cIn the Me Too movement, I always believe a woman. But in this case, we need to reserve our judgment. Two things here - one the film is as important as the movement and second, I have known Hirani for many years and I respect him as a filmmaker and a man. I will talk about it at length when the movie is released. But what if it\u2019s (allegations) aren\u2019t true, the movement will get derailed,\u201d she had said.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nfilmibeat.com\nAnd Twitter was quick to call her out for being a \u201chypocrite\u201d.\nSonam Kapoor comes of as a hypocrite often. \u2014 \u2744\ufe0f (@preethla) January 30, 2019\nSonam Kapoor's \"feminism\" is flakier than the chicken puffs sold in Malad's bakeries.
