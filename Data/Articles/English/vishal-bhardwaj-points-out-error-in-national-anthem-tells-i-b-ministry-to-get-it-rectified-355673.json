There is a technical glitch at \"Gahe Tav Jai Gaatha\", seems to be a sound transfer issue. Goes off tune and hurts ear and soul. Can @MIB_India please get this rectified? \u2014 Vishal Bhardwaj (@VishalBhardwaj) October 29, 2018\nVishal Bhardwaj is basking in the success of Pataakha starring Sanya Malhotra and Radhika Madan. He will soon come up with a crime thriller titled Sapna Didi, which will star Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan. However, the movie is halted because of Irrfan Khan\u2019s health condition.
