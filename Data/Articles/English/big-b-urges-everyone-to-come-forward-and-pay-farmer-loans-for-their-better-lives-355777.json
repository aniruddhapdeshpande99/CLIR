I felt very bad reading this. When I came back, I contacted an NGO here and asked them if I could be of any help in saving the lives of farmers and that's how I got a list of 30-40 people whose loans I could pay off. A few years ago, there was distress in Vidarbha due to the shortage of rainfall and I cleared loans of around 100 farmers and recently in Maharashtra, I have ensured that the loans of around 360 farmers have been paid off to the banks. My next step is to help clear loans of approximately 850 farmers in Uttar Pradesh.\"He said that by mentioning this, he is hopeful that even if around 10 or 12 people, who find it within their capacity and capability, step forward and help in saving the lives of farmers, they would have \"set an example for many more and in turn so many farmers' lives would be saved\".\nHe added,\n\"I would urge people to understand the plight of our 'anna-data' (farmers) and the kind of hardships they are facing. I do not want to boast about myself but I want everyone to help our farmers who face the shortage of even having basic necessities. If anyone of you, individually or collectively can pay off their loans, I join my hands to request you to please help them. This will be the biggest contribution you can make to the farmers of our country.\"\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "Big B Urges Everyone To Come Forward And Pay Farmer Loans For Their Better Lives!", "date_publish": "31/10/2018, 12:44:47", "description": "Save Farmers and Pay Off Their Loans, Urges Amitabh Bachchan A farmer named Anantkumar Khanke made it to the show, and spoke about his struggle to survive.
