We went to a bar and she was partying with her friends. After a few drinks she got a bit aggressive and then she just wanted to go somewhere. But since I was really tired, I said \u2018why don\u2019t you go, I will just go back\u2019. She just left me in the bar. I didn\u2019t have any money, my mobile phone. It was in her bag.

I said I am more than happy to leave this room in Miami. Then I went partying with the other girls and it was so much fun. I should have come alone to Miami.
