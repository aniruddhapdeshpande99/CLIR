She said,\n\u201cThe most special moment was when the curtains opened and I saw him at the altar and life was okay at that moment.\u201d\nTalking about life after marriage she said, \u201cWomen are always expected to have to shift their focus after love or marriage, but Nick didn\u2019t expect me to do that. I\u2019ve never had a guy who has said to be ambitious and do what you want to do.\u201d\nShe spoke about outfits at both the Hindu and Christian weddings, designed by Sabyasachi and Ralph Lauren. For her, it wasn't just about fashion but this was something very 'personal' for her. She added,\n\u201cI wanted something unique. Both the dresses- red and white - were personalised for me... I wanted the longest veil in the world and I got that. The outfits were personal choices.\u201d\nAfter seeing the pictures from her Christian wedding, Sabyasachi's official Instagram page recently shared some more photos from their Hindu wedding ceremony.
