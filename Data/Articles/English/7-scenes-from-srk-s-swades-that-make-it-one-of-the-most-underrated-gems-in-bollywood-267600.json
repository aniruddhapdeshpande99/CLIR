Even though Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades could not claim box-office success, the film still remains one of the most underrated gems in Hindi cinema.\nWhether it was Mohan and Geeta's romance, Mohan and Kaveri-Amma's conversations or the sincerity with which Gowariker managed to throw the spotlight on the ground realities of India's villages, Swades was a film that had its heart in the right place.\nDon't Miss 343 SHARES 555 SHARES 263 SHARES 449 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES\nFrom A.R Rahman's music to Shah Rukh Khan's acting, Swades is a timeless classic the brilliance of which can't be calculated on the basis of the monetary benefits the film claimed. Today, as the film completes 12 years since its official release, let's look back and recall 7 iconic scenes that will fill you with nostalgia.\nScreenGrab\nHere's an ode to Geeta, Mohan, Kaveri Amma and Cheeku, the characters who have stayed with us through the years. Have a look.\n1. Kaveri Amma wins the bet: \" Atkan Batkan, Dahi Chatokan..Tu Yashoda, main hoon Mohan... \"\nThe scene where Mohan reunites with Kaveri Amma after years is absolutely heartwarming. Kaveri Amma won the bet that she had with Geeta that Mohan wouldn't return. And when he does, the smile that we see on Kaveri Amma's face is priceless. This definitely remains one of the most touching scenes from the film.\n2. Mohan's confrontation with the villagers: \"Main nahi manta hamara desh duniya ka sabse mahaan desh hai ... lekin yeh zaroor manta hoon ... ki hum mein kabliyat hai, taqat hai, apne desh ko mahaan banane ki..\"\nSwades managed to reflect the harsh realities of villages in India and the whole passing the buck game Indians love to play. Instead of sugar-coating the bitter realities of a developing country like India, Mohan's monologue from the film was bang on.\n3. Mohan and Geeta's subtle yet heartening romance: \"Main chalta hon, hum dono saath saath chalte hain..\"\nThe first time Mohan visits Geeta, she shows her displeasure even though her smirk and smile is too evident to miss. That was the beginning of a relationship that grows over time in the film.\nThe second time Mohan visits Geeta in the school, she quizzes him, thinking he'd be unaware about India. But what follows is a conversation that is deep and beautiful.\n4. Geeta rejects an arranged marriage proposal: \"Ladkiyon ke haath sirf Mehendi ke liye nahi hote..\"\nThe film was way ahead of its time. At a time where filmmakers hardly took risks by taking up a social subject, Ashutosh Gowariker's Swades was way ahead of its time for reasons more than one. In the scene where Geeta turns down a marriage proposal because the guy wanted \"Ek stree ka kaam sirf ghar par kaam karna hai..\"(A woman's work is only to take care of the household) was brilliant. Geeta's monolog while justifying her reason to turn down the proposal was followed by a healthy debate between Geeta-Mohan and Kaveri Amma.\n5. Mohan's stint with ground realities of the village - the train scene remains one of the most unforgettable scenes from the film\nMohan's well paying NASA job in America could not give him a glance of ground realities in his own country. The train scene where SRK buys a glass of water from a kid is powerful. Even without a single dialogue in the film, the scene manages to hit the right chords.\n6. Mohan meets Haridas and is moved by his grief and poverty: Mere aasuon ka swad ... mere mann ka namak hi samajhta hai\nMohan meets Haridas to tell him to pay back the debt but instead his story, hospitality, and grief moves Mohan to the extent that he ends up extending monetary help to Haridas and his family.\n7. Geeta's confession and the 'parting gift'\nInstead of dramatising Mohan's decision of leaving the country, Gowarikar's attempt to highlight the subtlety of Mohan and Geeta's relationship was beautiful. While Geeta confesses her love to Mohan and hands him a parting gift, their conversation was beautiful.", "title": "7 Scenes From SRK's 'Swades' That Make It One Of The Most Underrated Gems In Bollywood", "date_publish": "17/12/2018, 18:55:23", "description": "14 years ago, on this very day, came a film that managed to leave many Bollywood fans absolutely awestruck.
