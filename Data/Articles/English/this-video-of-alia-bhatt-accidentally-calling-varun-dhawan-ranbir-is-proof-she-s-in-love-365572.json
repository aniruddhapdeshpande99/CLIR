(@Ciiimonex) April 13, 2019\nWonder how will RK react to Alia\u2019s this adorable galti se mistake. Alia and Ranbir are in a relationship since a year now and the couple doesn\u2019t seem to be hesitant in expressing their love in public.\nRanbir who always preferred to keep his personal relationships away from the media glare has no qualms in openly hugging, kissing and holding his girlfriend Alia's hand in public. Looks like the couple has found their comfortable zone.", "title": "This Video Of Alia Bhatt Accidentally Calling Varun Dhawan 'Ranbir' Is Proof She's In Love", "date_publish": "16/04/2019, 17:18:06", "description": "Alia Bhatt who is in a ishq waala love with beau Ranbir Kapoor seems like doesn\u2019t have got enough off him yet.
