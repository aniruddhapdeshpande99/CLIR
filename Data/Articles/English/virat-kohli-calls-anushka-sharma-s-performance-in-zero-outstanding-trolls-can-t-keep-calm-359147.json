Like beauty, love lies in the eye of the beholder.\nAnd who better than Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma can teach you that?

On the other hand, Virat Kohli also never leaves an opportunity to praise his ladylove.\nSo, recently, when Virat Kohli, who is in Australia for the test series, watched Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif starrer Zero, he couldn\u2019t stop gushing over the love of his life.\nThe movie, which has otherwise been receiving flak and getting trolled, was praised by Virat Kohli.
