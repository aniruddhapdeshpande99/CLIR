That it got rejected by so many people... when you make a film like that for three years and it goes wrong... you get not depressed or anything but...I didn't want to see it. I am going to see it after three months. Maybe I will be able to figure out when I am away what went wrong with it.\"\nShah Rukh was overwhelmed to get a warm and happy welcome, as he tweeted \"I am red all over\". \"When I walked out, suddenly they screamed... and for a moment I thought they were doing it for something else or someone else.
