{"text": "When we first heard that the nation\u2019s long-reigning heart throb had found true love, and was ready to settle down, you could almost hear a million hearts break. In a world where heart throbs come and go, Milnd Soman has endured through the decades, and still stood out in a sea of younger A-listers like Ranveer Singh, Ranbir Kapoor, and Varun Dhawan.\nTimesfashion\nFrom his bare-chested debut in Alisha Chinai\u2019s Made In India in the early 90s to his bare-all appearance in the Tuff Shoes ad, crushing on Milind has been constant\u2026and then he got married.\nIn a surprise and private ceremony, Milind tied the knot earlier this year with Ankita Konwar, a Delhi girl , who was a cabin crew.\nMilind/FC\nDon't Miss 862 SHARES 346 SHARES 183 SHARES\nWe recently caught up with the new Mrs Soman and found out what living with the hot Iron Man Of India was like. We also asked her why she chose 2018 to settle down and what the year had taught her.\nFirst things first, no interview would be incomplete without discussing her love for running.\n1. For Ankita, running has become her passion but it did not happen overnight\nHaving a background of a cabin crew, Ankita was never into sports. But like they say, love makes you do insane things. In her case, it did her good. Ankita was never a runner but eventually the sport just grew on her. \"Once you run 10 km, you want to do 21 km then you want to take up half a marathon. By then, you feel the need to do a full marathon. It's safe to declare my love for running, because it gives me an all-time high.\u201d\n2. Ankita is grateful that Milind introduced her to running barefoot\nTalking about the difference between running barefoot and with shoes on, Ankita explains, \"I was never comfortable running in shoes, so I took up running barefoot. There's no denying that Milind was the inspiration behind it. It's all about getting practice, once you start running without chappals, you become more aware of your surroundings. But it's not that I only run barefoot, I wear slippers too.\"\n3. Because when you're in love, long distances, age gaps or even your profession should not come in the way.\nOn finding true love with Milind, Ankita sounds elated. \u201cHe makes me happy, happier than I ever thought I will be Our marriage is something, I can never explain in words. We chose this year, in particular, because I was in Delhi and the long distance was too difficult to deal with. We couldn't stay apart from each other, and decided to tie the knot. 2018 felt like any other year, but it was more perfect than ever.\" Because when and if you're in love, long distances, age gaps, profession should not come in the way.\n4. Age gap between Milind and her did not stop her from falling in love with him\nShe also spoke about the resistance, she faced when she first told her family that Milind was the one. She admitted that her family behaved like any other family who were slightly alarmed at my choice but clearly that did not stop her from taking the plunge and getting married.\n\"I never looked at our relationship as having a huge age gap (Milind is 53, while Ankita is 27). My life was a simple one back home in Delhi. I was never into dating or having relationships. I preferred to stay single, but when Milind came along, things felt different. However, I knew him for several years before taking the plunge.\"\nShe also revealed how despite being the hottest celebrity of India, Milind is actually an introvert and so is she. \"Milind and I are two introverts, who only open up to each other,\u201d says Ankita.\n5. No matter how big a star you are, don't forget to be kind\n2018 was a great learning experience for her. She may have married a star, but despite the trappings of stardom, Ankita feels one should not forget to be kind and we agree.\n6. Always consider your husband as a best friend and life will be easier\nTo all the women who have tied the knot this year including celebrities, Ankita knows the tips and tricks of a successful marriage. \"One needs to stay positive and humble. I don't look at Milind as a star but as my best friend. All you have to do is live in the moment, and learn to be positive throughout your ups and downs.\"\n7. #Metoo movement: Learn to support one another in these tough times\nThe 27-year-old also spoke about the on-going #MeToo movement that took India by storm. \"We have to support each other. If people are coming out and telling their stories, it is for us to believe in them and not criticise them. As women, it's our duty to come forward and support another woman.\u201d she says.\nBefore signing off, Ankita said she's open to the idea of featuring in a reality show with her husband if the offer is good enough.\nInstagram/Ankita Konwar\nWhen Ankita is not running or posting adorable photos with Milind, she is singing, writing, reading or playing the guitar. Ankita was a cabin crew and enjoyed her short stint flying. Today she enjoys running a lot more and why not, she's running alongside the love of her life.\nHere\u2019s hoping 2019 is even better for Ankita and Milind.", "title": "Stay Humble And Positive Despite Life\u2019s Highs And Lows, Says Milind Soman's Wife Ankita Konwar", "date_publish": "15/12/2018, 13:19:21", "description": "It was a shock for the entire country when the heart throb of the nation was taken away.
