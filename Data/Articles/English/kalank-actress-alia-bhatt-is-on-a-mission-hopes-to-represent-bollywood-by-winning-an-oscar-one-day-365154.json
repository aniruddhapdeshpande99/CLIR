Alia Bhatt is spectacular and wants to continue to be the same.\nTwitter\nWe met Alia for an interaction where we spoke about her upcoming film Kalank and lot more. Looking a little dull due to being unwell, she still happily answered all the questions.\nFirstly, we asked her about her upcoming Kalank comparison with Sanjay Leela Bhansali films, to which she said \u201cWe expected it because I don\u2019t think anyone has touched this world except Bhansali sir. Abhishek is very inspired by Sanjay sir\u2019s work, but it is a very different film, while the look of the film looks similar, the world is his own world, I think it\u2019s a great thing, also I feel Abhishek will take it as a compliment.\u201d\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 336 SHARES 247 SHARES 699 SHARES 263 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES\nAlia also said Kalank was not an easy project, it was taxing and took a toll over her, \u201c I wouldn\u2019t say Kalank was fun and game, because it was not, -it was a taxing and intense experience but it was very rich in challenging, it was not like we were angry on sets. The feeling was like okay, I really worked hard and earned my sleep for that night.\u201d\nTwitter\nShe clarified, \u201cWhat took a toll on me was that I was working on Kalank and Brahmastra at the same time, nowadays you are not just doing movies you are doing ads and lots of things, so I have been working constantly. Last year I didn\u2019t have a single day off for me\u201d.\nWhen asked why doesn\u2019t she slow down with her career and she replies, \u201c I thought of it that I did 3 films last year and I can\u2019t, so I should just slow, but this year I am doing 4 films, so it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t learn from my own thinking. Point is that I want to do it, and why should I slow down? I will slow down when I need to.\u201d\nAlia is right now the most talked about and bankable actress. Everyone is praising her or eyeing her work, when we asked her if it affects her and she has a zen like answer ready,\n\u201c The world only exists the day you opened your eyes, what appears in front of me is only what I choose to look at, so whatever chatter happens about me whether it is positive or negative, I don\u2019t pay too much attention to it, when people say good things I obviously feel wow and if people say not so good things I am okay, they don\u2019t feel a certain way, so it\u2019s fine, I have a very like Buddha attitude to all of it. I anyway have so much attention going around me, I am trying to do so much more with my every character and film, I am a producer now, I am doing other social things, so one person can think of only these many things at a time and I also have family and friends to think about so I don\u2019t really pay attention to chatter around me.\u201d\nReaching this high was definitely Alia\u2019s dream,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I thought it but I definitely hoped it, I have always hoped and dreamt big and not like unimaginable big but yaa I hope to win an Oscar someday.\u201d We totally back her on this.\nTwitter\nWhen asked if she is expecting National Award for Raazi, she said, \u201cLast time also, I was told that I will get it for Udta Punjab but nothing happened, so I don\u2019t want people to tell me until it comes to me.\u201d\nTwitter\nLastly we quizzed her if she became more careful after Shaandaar failure and she clarified, \u201c Even with Shaandaar, I loved the script but through the film making process the script changed and that\u2019s what went wrong with the film, it started with A and ended with E, I had the same process before and after Shaandaar, but it has given ability to become aware, and if your instincts say it wrong you say it, that\u2019s what it thought me, to always say what I am feeling even if maybe back short or push down but say it because your indicts is always right.\u201d\nAlia Bhatt is undoubtedly one of the best actresses we have in B-town right now and here's hoping she continues to be one.", "title": "'Kalank' Actress Alia Bhatt Is On A Mission, Hopes To Represent Bollywood By Winning An Oscar One Day", "date_publish": "10/04/2019, 18:54:44", "description": "There is no stopping for this girl.
