I want to take up this moment to share a few thoughts that have been in my heart for a while. I wanted to wait to speak out until the case ended, but it\u2019s taken longer than expected. I don\u2019t know where to start from. It is difficult to express some feelings when so many people, so many emotions are involved. First, I want to thank those who have stood by me like a pillar of strength. It has been a long journey that started when I was still trying to understand life.\nI have been fighting the case in court for the last 6 years, with patience and respect, waiting for the trial to be completed. In this process, I have been called a murderer, a criminal, an abuser and so much worse. I read these things about me almost every single day. And my heartfelt effort has always been to be strong, respectful and ignore it. But they still fill my and my loved ones\u2019 heart with so much sadness. I don\u2019t blame the people who call me names, because that\u2019s how I have been portrayed in public, but I'm not the monster that has been portrayed in headlines.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nI know how easy it is to think the worst of someone and accuse them but it is exceptionally hard to prove myself innocent as there\u2019s a procedure that we need to follow. A procedure that has taken long enough that I have been made to feel guilty without even being given a fair chance to prove my innocence. There have been accusations and assumptions but there has been no validation.\nBut, this is not about what others say. This is about how I feel. For as long as I can remember, my dream has always been to make my parents proud. I have always tried to be a good son to them. In the last 6 years, I\u2019ve tried harder every day to achieve this dream and to be positive.\nSo today, I am praying with my heart that our family can move forward, that the trial can come to a fair end and that I can give back all the love, support and strength I have received from so many of you.\nThank you to all of you who constantly send positivity my way. You may not know it, but every single one of your prayers has helped.\"\nJust to jog your memory a little, Actor Jiah Khan committed suicide in 2013 in her flat in Juhu, Mumbai, by hanging herself.\nIn her suicide note, she wrote about Sooraj and mentioned how he ruined his life.
