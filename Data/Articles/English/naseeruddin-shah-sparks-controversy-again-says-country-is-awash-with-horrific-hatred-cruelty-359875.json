{"text": "Just when Naseeruddin Shah's controversial remark in reference to \u201canxious about children\u2019s safety\u201d had faded into obscurity, the veteran actor has once again sparked another controversy.\nNaseeruddin Shah has apparently turned Amnesty India\u2019s ambassador and in one of their recently released videos, he can be seen talking about \u201cmassive crackdown on freedom of expression and human rights defenders\u201d and expressing concern over muzzling \u201cvoices of dissent\u201d.\nAFP\nThe campaign is called \u2018Ab Ki Baar Manav Adhikaar'. Interestingly, the pictures used in the video during his monologue are of urban naxals.\nIn the video, he says, \u201cThose who demand rights are being locked away. Artists, actors scholars, poets are all being stifled. Journalists too are being silenced. In the name of religion, walls of hate are being erected. Innocents are being killed.\nScreengrab\n\u201cHad we dreamt of a country where there is no space for dissent? Where only rich and powerful are heard, and where the poorest and most vulnerable are forever oppressed? Where there once was law, there is now only darkness\u201d.\nHere\u2019s the video:\nIn 2018, India witnessed a massive crackdown on freedom of expression and human rights defenders. Let's stand up for our constitutional values this new year and tell the Indian government that its crackdown must end now. #AbkiBaarManavAdhikaar pic.twitter.com/e7YSIyLAfm \u2014 Amnesty India (@AIIndia) January 4, 2019\nDon't Miss 623 SHARES 233 SHARES 232 SHARES 870 SHARES 1 K SHARES\nAnd now he is facing flak on Twitter:\nThis type of anti-india fake propaganda will strengthen our intension to re-elect Modiji as a PM.#ModiOnceMore\n( Amnesty India is under scanner for alleged financial irregularities)https://t.co/KEeOtxAz3i \u2014 Jatan Acharya \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@jatanacharya) January 4, 2019\nIf #NaseeruddinShah is not honest enough to join political pparty before giving political statements, how he could be honest in his opinion ? https://t.co/KEeOtxAz3i \u2014 Jatan Acharya \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@jatanacharya) January 4, 2019\nI had a great respect for you as an actor.but from few days you are suffering from some disease.
