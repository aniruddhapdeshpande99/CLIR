However, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out plagiarism, right?\nWhat happened recently is definitely a rarity. American rapper T-Pain has been accused of plagiarising a recurring flute melody from Arijit Singh\u2019s popular song from Aashiqui 2, Tum Hi Ho.\nFilm\u2019s director Mohit Suri was the first one who brought this to people\u2019s attention.\nMusic composer Mithoon was also taken aback when it came to his notice.\nSir, the melody that you have used in your new song is my original work for a previously released Hindi film..The Label is looking into this.#tumhiho #Aashiqui2 https://t.co/5fnDf4sfg7 \u2014 Mithoon (@Mithoon11) December 15, 2018\nAnd soon, T-pain became a victim of trolls.

Sooooo yea. I definitely didn\u2019t produce this song. Had no idea that was a sample and have never heard the music before I got the beat from the producer. Easy thing to work out. The labels will be in contact. Thanx \u2014 T-Pain (@TPAIN) December 15, 2018\nSome people were just amazed by seeing all this happening for real.\nThe irony in seeing Bollywood fans attacking T Pain for sampling Tum Hi Ho on a trap beat, when Bollywood literally takes a WHOLE composition claiming it as their own track.\nC'mon guys, lol. \u2014 Bhaveek N. Makan (@TehBhav) December 16, 2018\nMeanwhile, T-pain\u2019s song which was titled That\u2019s Yo Money has been pulled off from YouTube.

If you want to know what\u2019s all the ruckus about, listen to the tune below:\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that T-series has been embroiled in an international battle. Remember the label\u2019s feud with Swedish internet celebrity PewDiePie over YouTube followers? They are competing against each other for most followed YouTube channel. In the recent development, after YouTube purged spam accounts, PewDiePie has once again beaten T-Series as the most subscribed channel.", "title": "T-Pain Accused Of Plagiarising Aashiqui 2 Song Tum Hi Ho, Gets Trolled By 'Brown Twitter'", "date_publish": "18/12/2018, 11:33:54", "description": "American rapper T-Pain has been accused of plagiarising a recurring flute melody from Arijit Singh\u2019s popular song from Aashiqui 2, Tum Hi Ho.
