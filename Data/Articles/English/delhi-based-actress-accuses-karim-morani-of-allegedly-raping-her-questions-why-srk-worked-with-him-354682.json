It was in 2015, when Morani came over to her place with a bottle of wine and forced her to drink.\n\"Next thing I know, I wake up at 4am. I was numb and shocked. Physically and mentally, I was in a state of shock. Karim was not there. I saw there were marks on my body when I woke up,\u201d she recounted.\n\u201cI found the courage and called him next day. I confronted him and asked him - what did you do to me? I told him I'd call his wife and brother. He just laughed over the phone. Can't forget that laughter. I felt helpless. I was 21,\u201d the actress continued.\nBollywoodCat\nShe revealed that later Morani started blackmailing her by saying, \"I'll get you killed by the underworld.\" She further said that Morani allegedly harassed her several times afterwards using her pictures as a ploy.\n\u201cThe after effects were that I stopped talking to people, stopped working, became a recluse. It wasn't just one time. He came over a couple of times more. It was 12th Sept 2015 and he calls me and says I want you to come here. I was scared he'd circulate my nude pictures to family. He sneaked me into the room. He didn't even let me leave.\"\nIt did not happen once but multiple times. No one supported her or backed her up.\nInstagram\nFor many who don't know, Morani is a top producer, having financed films like Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone-starrer Chennai Express.
