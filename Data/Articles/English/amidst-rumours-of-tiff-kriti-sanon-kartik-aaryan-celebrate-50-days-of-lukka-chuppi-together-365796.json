{"text": "As an industry, Bollywood is sometimes a funny place. All it takes is just one picture for media to start floating news of tiffs and break ups. While Luka Chuppi turned out to be a big hit, strong rumors suggested that Kriti Sanon and Kartik Aaryan are not even on talking terms.\nThere were rumours that Kriti was upset with Kartik for hogging the limelight and taking sole credit for the success of the film. Talking to a tabloid, Kriti Sanon had stated,\nInstagram\n\u201cThis business of overlooking the leading lady has been going on for a while and it\u2019s so unfair. I am glad this conversation is finally happening. It\u2019s logical to talk about only the male protagonist when the leading lady doesn\u2019t have a lot to do, but when they are both carrying a film on their shoulders, the credit should be equally shared. Everybody deserves a mention.\u201d\nFurthermore, the reports suggested that things are bitter between the two actors. But amidst all these reports, Kriti and Kartik's social media activities hint that all's well.\nInstagram\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nOn Friday, Luka Chuppi co-stars Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon took to Twitter to take a 'not so sly' dig at these reports.In his post, Kartik wrote,\n\u201cAjii sunti ho !!!
