After all, we shared everything, you and I. I told you my deepest, darkest secrets. I showed you exactly what people are capable of. I shocked you with my honesty, but mostly I challenged you and made you think.\"\n\"You trusted me even though you knew you shouldn't. So we're not done, no matter what anyone says, and I know what you want. You want me back,\" he says in the clip.\nReuters\n\"Of course, some believed everything and have been waiting with bated breath to hear me confess it all, they're just dying to have me declare that everything said is true and that I got what I deserved.
