It has been 11 years since Iron Man was released, and in all these years, Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown so rapidly that it is now the biggest franchise of all time. And it\u2019s all because of Iron Man AKA Robert Downey, Jr.\nvia GIPHY\nCan you even imagine any other actor in that role? When the makers of the film were a little skeptical to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the role because of his controversial past, director Jon Favreau unremittingly campaigned for him. And then, as they say, a star was born.\nvia GIPHY\nNot many people know that when he was six, his father fed him marijuana and he pretty much spent his major chunk of life in rehabs thereafter. He is sober since 2003. And his charisma and personality are making people swoon since then.\nHe is witty, sarcastic and humorous. Robert Downey, Jr. is just not a celebrity but a phenomenon. He is hailed as the ultimate Avengers by his fans.\nWhen the rumours were rife that he is quitting Marvel after Avengers: Endgame, fans were disheartened. Isn\u2019t it impossible to picture MCU without him?\nDon't Miss 264 SHARES 233 SHARES 4.3 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nThe man who has upped the game of Marvel is celebrating his 54th birthday today, and fans are pouring out their love for him.
