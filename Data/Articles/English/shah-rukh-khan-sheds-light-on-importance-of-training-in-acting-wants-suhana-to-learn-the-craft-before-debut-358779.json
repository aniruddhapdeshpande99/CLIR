Didn\u2019t we all think that anyone can be picked from the streets and taught acting? All you need is a face and a great physique, right?\nBut times are changing. Actors who earlier played sidekicks \u2013 like Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Vicky Kaushal \u2013 are now playing main leads and on the other hand, several films of the big stars including Salman Khan\u2019s Race 3 have failed miserably at the box office.\nAFP\nShedding light on the importance of training in acting, Shah Rukh Khan recently said he wants his daughter, Suhana Khan, who aspires to be an actress, to learn acting and practice it \u2013 do theatre for three-four years \u2013 before she make her Bollywood debut.\nDon't Miss 193 SHARES 5.1 K SHARES 357 SHARES 763 SHARES 153 SHARES\n\u201cIn India, I think we don't learn acting, we just assume that we are talented. Like if you drive very first, it first mean you are going to become a Formula 1 driver. You'll have to finally learn it. So I want her to have a formal training in acting. The experience matters a lot,\u201d he said.\nTwitter\nHe, furthermore, said that he wants her to learn the craft. He revealed she visited him on the sets of his upcoming film Zero to observe how things work.\n\u201cShe came on sets because learning acting has a lot to do with spending time on the sets and learning production. She did the same in London and while she was here.She said she still has two weeks to go back to London and we were shooting a song for 'Zero' in the coming two weeks. So she came here to have that experience.\nTwitter\nShah Rukh Khan said that he wanted Suhana to learn the nuances from Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif.\n\u201cI wanted her to see Anushka and Katrina perform live as both are such different kind of actors. Katrina has her own charm and Anushka has her own way of enacting things. So I wanted her to spend time (on sets). So what they did is they put her onto me as an assistant director.\n\"But I think ground experience is good for actors or any kind of job, only as an internship. But you have to finish your education first. If you have the opportunity to study, it formalises and makes your craft better. So, I want her to study first for some time.\"\nAlso Read: Ranveer Wins Best Actor For Padmaavat, Leaves Wife Deepika Teary-Eyed With His Emotional Speech\nWith inputs from PTI", "title": "Shah Rukh Khan Sheds Light On Importance Of Training In Acting, Wants Suhana To Learn The Craft Before Debut", "date_publish": "17/12/2018, 19:00:12", "description": "Shedding light on the importance of training in acting, Shah Rukh Khan recently said he wants his daughter, Suhana Khan, who aspires to be an actress, to learn acting and practice it \u2013 do theatre for three-four years \u2013 before she make her Bollywood debut.", "authors": ["Garima Satija"], "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/shah-rukh-khan-sheds-light-on-importance-of-training-in-acting-wants-suhana-to-learn-the-craft-before-debut-358779.html\n", "image_url": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2018/Dec/shah_rukh_khan_sheds_light_on_importance_of_training_in_acting_wants_suhana_to_learn_the_craft_bef_1545051642_800x420.jpg"}
