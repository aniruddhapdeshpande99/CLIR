{"text": "In his career spanning over 45 years, Kader Khan had spread across laughter and happiness. Known for his comic roles in the \u201890s, Kader Khan passed away at the age of 81 at a hospital in Toronto, after being hospitalised for about four months.\nBCCL\nRecently, he had developed breathing issues after which he was transferred from a regular ventilator to BiPAP ventilator. The actor, who was suffering from progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative disease that causes loss of balance, dementia, and difficulty in walking, had slipped into coma.\nAmong other actors who grieved the death of the veteran star was Govinda, who has worked with Kader Khan in many films. They shared an amazing camaraderie and together, they tickled our funny bones too. Bidding him goodbye, Govinda paid a heartfelt tribute to Kader Khan.
