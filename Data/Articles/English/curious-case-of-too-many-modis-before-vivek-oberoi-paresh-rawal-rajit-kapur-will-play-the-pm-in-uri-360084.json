Before Vivek Oberoi & Paresh Rawal, Rajit Kapur Will Play The PM In 'Uri'\nUnless you have been living under a rock, we are sure you know that Vivek Oberoi\u2019s Bollywood career has apparently been revived as the actor is all set to play the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his biopic.\nEver since the first look of the movie is out, it is making waves on social media. There is so much buzz around it that all dining table discussions revolve around it.\nAhead of the elections, most debates on social media obviously revolve around politics, but now people have another reason to talk about the political climate of the nation. After all, so many movies \u2013 including Uri: The surgical Strike, PM Narendra Modi, The Accidental Prime Minister and Thackeray among others \u2013 based on political leaders are going to be released on the big screen soon.\nIf things weren\u2019t complicated enough already, to entangle you in the cobweb of confusion even further, let us tell you that you\u2019ll see PM Modi\u2019s character in not one but three movies.\nThe first, you know is a biopic on the PM, and Vivek Oberoi is playing the lead role.\nThe second one, is another biopic on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and in this one Paresh Rawal will play the titular role.\nThis movie was announced by Rawal in 2017. However, there wasn\u2019t any update on it post that. Of course, Vivek Oberoi's project on PM Modi came as a huge shock to Paresh Rawal as well.\n\u201cI still maintain that nobody can play Modi other than me. I can do complete justice to the role. However, it\u2019s a free country and even Vivek can play that role. I wish him luck. What I can do with that film, nobody else can. Let anybody do what they want to, we are also coming out soon.\u201d he told The Asian Age.\nDon't Miss 6.8 K SHARES 870 SHARES 828 SHARES\nThe third film that will feature a character based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi is Uri: The Surgical Strike \u2013 that stars Vicky Kaushal in the lead role and is releasing on Jan 11.\nWondering who is playing Modi in this film? Rajit Kapur. To jog your memory a little, Rajit Kapur played the role of Alia Bhatt's father in Raazi, and now he\u2019ll be seen playing Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Uri: The Surgical Strike.\nIf reports are to be believed, his role is limited to a few scenes, which will be not more than a cameo appearance, but still, it\u2019s going to be interesting to watch so many Modis on screen, don\u2019t you agree?\nAnd then why would people talk about these movies being propaganda?", "title": "Curious Case Of Too Many Modis!
