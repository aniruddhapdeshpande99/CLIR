This man makes everything so simple and pure around you.\nSo, I met the affable Jagu da one evening and the moment I entered the room, he quickly pulled the chair for me to sit beside him (chivalry is in his blood). In fact, he even suggested that I sit opposite the sun as the direct sun rays would disturb me. He won me over then and there.\nTwitter\nEnjoying the sunlight, when asked how does he manage to be so grounded and polite, he spoke in his element, \"Kya bhidu apun toh chillar hai\". He then said, \u201cI have seen lots of big actors losing their stardom, I am just a chillar in front of them, I am nothing, it\u2019s my luck that I came here from a chawl. When I see all these big stars losing their stardom you automatically understand that success and stardom is nothing, I am just fortunate to achieve this success, but I cannot carry this for life. We all will die one day, I just want to be remembered in good ways. Life is just simple and I take it as it is.\u201d\nDon't Miss 1.1 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\nTwitter\nFurther he reminisced about how he became an actor and then earned fame, \u201cKaash made me the actor, then Doodh Ka Karz, Police Office, Izaat brought me fame. I came from the streets and became an actor, that's what is difficult to digest, then people told me to do both types of movies where on one hand I earned money and on the other hand, I got awards. I just closed my eyes and chose whatever came my way.\u201d\nHe has done 250 films so far.\nTwitter\nJackie Shroff is such a flamboyant personality, but he is a different person altogether when he is onscreen, it\u2019s really magical, when asked about how he switches from Jaggu Dada to his onscreen character, he answered, \u201cI put my skin in my character. I cannot become Jaggu on the sets. I was and I am an introvert person, but when I talk, I open myself so much that people get worried, and if i don\u2019t talk, I will not utter a single word. Talking about transforming myself into a character, It\u2019s normal, as a day to day life, doctors do their job when they are in the hospital, journalists do their job when they are on the field, in the same way, I do my job when I am on sets, sab labeling hai bhidu\u201d, he concluded with a wink.\nTwitter\nIn the middle of the interview, he even offered me vada pav and requested a maska bun for himself and that moment for me was just epic, this man has no air of being a superstar at all. Jaggu Dada then said, he believes in simplicity and 'nothing can change that in me', he even shared how he learned the hardest lessons of his life,\n\u201cWhen I lost my mom, I was cold. I couldn\u2019t understand what to do, I wanted to go with her, But I couldn\u2019t go with her and then I understood life. You are talking about me being grounded, who am I? Nothing. Jitna mila utha le, jo nahi mila who mera tha hi nahi. Anyway, I am not going to take this stardom along when I leave this world so what\u2019s the use of holding it. We all are same, just remember that.\u201d\nBefore ending the interview, we asked him if he advises his son Tiger Shroff to be like him, he said, \"My kids learned everything from their mother Ayesha as I did from my mother. Tiger learned both the things, when he was with me, he used to learn lots of abusive languages, while he learned etiquette from his mom. He is a great child\".\nAll we can say is that his ideology towards life is so simple and powerful. One can never get enough of him. At the professional front, he will be seen next in RAW along with John Abraham.", "title": "Jackie Shroff Believes In Holding On To His Roots, Says Everyone Is Same At The End Of The Day", "date_publish": "20/03/2019, 17:55:02", "description": "It was the loveliest day of my life as entertainment when I met bhidu of Bollywood Jackie Shroff.
