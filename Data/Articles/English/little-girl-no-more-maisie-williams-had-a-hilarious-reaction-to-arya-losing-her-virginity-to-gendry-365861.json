Maisie Williams Had A Hilarious Reaction To Arya Losing Her Virginity To Gendry\nGame Of Thrones season 8 episode two was perhaps the last one where we saw everyone alive and together. Winter is soon coming for everyone, and they\u2019re all prepared to die.\nTwitter\nBefore the Great War could begun, while some spent the night drinking together, Arya Stark wanted to apparently lose her virginity before the battle with the army of dead begins the next morning. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to die tomorrow, I want to know what this feels like before that happen,\u201d she says.\nTwitter\nAlthough, in Game Of Thrones we\u2019ve all seen a lot of sex and nudity. But this one was quite unexpected. Not only the fans, even Maisie Williams who essays the role of Arya Stark on the show was taken by surprise after she read the script.\nTwitter\nMaisie Williams said that her friend Sophie Turner had read this portion of the script before her and she called her up to tell her to read this too. When she read it, she felt it was joke. Maisie was just not ready to believe.\nDon't Miss 596 SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 406 SHARES 1.3 K SHARES\n\u201cAt first I thought it was a prank\u2026 I was like, \u2018Yo, good one.\u2019 And [the showrunners were] like, \u2018No, we haven\u2019t done that this year.\u2019 Oh f\u2014k!\u201d\nTwitter\nMaisie Williams had joined Game Of Thrones when she was 11-years-old. Most of the people who have appeared nude on the show had signed on when they were 18-years-old. Since Maisie, who is now 22, was comparatively young, showrunners let her decide precisely how much to show.\n\u201cSo I kept myself pretty private. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s important for Arya to flash. This beat isn\u2019t really about that. And everybody else has already done it on the show, so\u2026\u201d\nHow was it like shooting for the scene? It was uncomfortable, she said.\n\u201cNo one wants to make you feel uncomfortable which kind of makes you feel more uncomfortable, because no one wants to look at anything that they shouldn\u2019t look at which in turn makes you feel like you look awful because everyone is kind of like\u2014\u201c [Williams averts her eyes]. \u201cYou want people to act more normal.\u201d\nFans can\u2019t get over what they saw in the last episode.
