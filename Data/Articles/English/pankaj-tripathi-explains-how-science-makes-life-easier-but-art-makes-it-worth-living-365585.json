{"text": "Pankaj Tripathi is one actor who is not just loved for his acting calibre, but people love his sincerity and humility as well.\nIn his recent interview, Pankaj Tripathi expressed how he believes a doctor can save a dying man, but an artiste can do a lot more: heal a dying society by questioning the wrong and upholding the right. The actor says an artist\u2019s work should never exist in vanity as while science makes life easier, arts give it a meaning.\n\u201cIn life, we have two segments: arts and science. We need science to make our lives easier. But what do we live for? We enjoy life through arts. So it\u2019s an artistes duty to question the wrongs happening in the society. \u201cTo make a satire out of it. To make people aware through their art forms \u2014 writing, painting, acting, etc\u201d Tripathi told PTI.\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nThe reason for the emphasis on an artiste to do work which reflects current scenario is, Tripathi says, art has the power to make people better. \u201cIf every individual starts listening to poetry, watch plays and see paintings, they\u2019ll become a better human. Art makes you a better human being and that reflects in society. Across the world, wherever good art has been created, that society has been in crisis.\u201d\n\u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092a\u0922\u093c\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901\u0964 \u0915\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092c\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b, \u0938\u092e\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0914\u0930 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u0915\u0949\u092e\u0947\u0902\u091f\u094d\u0938 \u0915\u094b\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0930\u0923\u093e \u0938\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u092f\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f\u0964\n\u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092e\u093e\u0927\u093e\u0935 \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f\u0964 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0928\u0932 \u091c\u0938\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0938 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u0940 \u091f\u0940\u092e \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u092b \u0938\u0947 \u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0906\u092a \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u0964 \u2014 \u092a\u0902\u0915\u091c \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u093e\u0920\u0940/Pankaj Tripathi (@TripathiiPankaj) April 7, 2019\nThe actor says his choices of films \u2014 and more specifically his characters \u2014 always have a commentary to make. \u201cI am an aware citizen so I want my characters to be aware too. They should be aware of what\u2019s happening in the society and make a commentary. They\u2019re not in a la la land.\n\u201cToday we have films made on several topics. Stree is an entertaining film but it has strong commentary about women. I make sure I say something important without being preachy through all my performances.\u201d The 42-year-old actor has been in the industry for nearly 15 years and has several critically-acclaimed performances to his credit. To make sure an actor never loses his edge, Tripathi says it is of utmost importance for one to be aware about the surroundings.\nTwitter\n\u201cAn actor must read a lot. Books not only make one a good actor, but also a better human being. Second, you must work on your senses. We don\u2019t realise but we are losing the sense of sound slowly. When was the last time you registered listening to a flowing river or a chirping bird? \u201cWe are losing the essence of touch. An actor has to work on his senses. You just have to be present for this, be aware. In life, we create. In cinema, actors recreate and for this, your mind and body need to be in sync.\u201d\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "Pankaj Tripathi Explains How Science Makes Life Easier But Art Makes It Worth Living", "date_publish": "16/04/2019, 18:32:32", "description": "\u201cIn life, we have two segments: arts and science.
