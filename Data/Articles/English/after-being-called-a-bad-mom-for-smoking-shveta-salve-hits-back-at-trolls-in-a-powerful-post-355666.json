I am real , honest and basic like that. It has to be of no reason that anyone ever judge me for the person I am or the Mommy I am .. I don\u2019t propagate it and neither do I question anyone else who does , so I would respect the same back . Today I got a few random DM\u2019s by totally random people about my actions , and I usually let such things go pass me but for some reason today I felt like addressing it . How does this make me a bad person or a bad mom ?? Do you see me wasting my Life ? Do you see me sitting unemployed n jobless ? Do you see me neglecting my child ? I work , I work multiple jobs , I\u2019m an actor , dancer , an entrepreneur . I successfully live in two major cities of our glorious country . I have beautiful friends whom I love and I know who love me back for the person I am . Risking the fact that I might sound aggressive but don\u2019t ever question my abilities of being a bad example to my child !! So tell me does an honest sex worker who sells her body to feed her family , to maybe get an education or to provide a life for her children is a Bad Person ? A Bad Mother ? A stigma to society ? Who are you and I to Judge ?? My parents taught me well and exposed me to the good and evil of everything . They smoked and drank too but they did a mighty fine job of raising my brother and I . As children we knew that this was not something we could practice until a certain age . And that too if we ever wanted to.. a choice that we were allowed to take as adults ... Today I share a drink with them , and celebrate the fact that they gave me a fabulous childhood n Life and I aspire to do the same with my Baby.. I don\u2019t pay for likes and followers , you choose to follow me for who I am . And hence what you see is me being me and you always have the option to unfollow me. Live and Let Live.. this rant has gotten me all irked so I\u2019m gonna go and pour myself a red and light up.\" (sic)", "title": "After Being Called A Bad Mom For Smoking, Shveta Salve Hits Back At Trolls In A Powerful Post", "date_publish": "29/10/2018, 18:29:05", "description": "Smoking is injurious to health \u2013 for a man and for a woman \u2013 irrespective of the gender, right?
