Yesterday, two tiger cubs died after being run over by a train in Chandrapur, Maharashtra. The cubs were reportedly just six months old. And so the number of tigers continues to dwindle and disappointment continues to prevail across the nation.\nMaharashtra: Two tiger cubs killed by train near Lohara forest area in Chandrapur pic.twitter.com/zs76VSvfR2 \u2014 ANI (@ANI) November 15, 2018\nAmong other people who were left angered, Bollywood actress Raveena Tandon also expressed her anger on Twitter. The actress, who is the brand ambassador of Sanjay Gandhi National Park and has been working with the Maharashtra government in conserving a sustainable habitat for wildlife in the state, angrily tweeted on how the government wants to build more highways and give away forest land.\nFurthermore, in a series of tweets, she also wrote that if this continues to happen, more such disasters will happen.\nCould\u2019ve been prevented if these ways are built but fenced off and underpasses are built for wildlife to move from forest to forest.
