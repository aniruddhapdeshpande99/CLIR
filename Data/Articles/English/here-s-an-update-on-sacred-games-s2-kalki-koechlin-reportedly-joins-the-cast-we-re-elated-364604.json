I got a call last night that I have to meet Varun Grover (the writer), so the team is trying to get our busy schedules matched. We may be in the clear about the role by next week, hopefully.\u201d\nHe added that Guruji was supposed to be kept a secret initially.\n\u201cMy character was kind of kept hidden. I shot for the series for just one day after the main shooting was over. They thought \u2018Let\u2019s bring this character into the light\u2019. Initially, that was not the plan. Something happened that they didn\u2019t announce this differently and I am not someone who likes tom-tomming.
