Some mercilessly wrote off his career, while others speculated that he had become a victim of the rockstar life. For almost two years, he went underground with no info or updates about his whereabouts.\nyoutube\nFor the uninitiated, he wasn\u2019t just a music enthusiast risen from the streets. Hirdesh Singh studied music at the prestigious Trinity School in the UK. Whether arrogance, success or alcohol played a role in his downfall, that still remains to be a mystery but Yo Yo Honey Singh phased out for a long long time.\ntwitter\nTalking about the same in an interview with the Times Of India, he said, \"The last 18 months were the darkest phase of my life, and I wasn't in a state to talk to anyone. I know there were rumours that I was in rehab, but I was in my Noida house throughout. The truth is I was suffering from bipolar disorder. It went on for 18 months, during which I changed four doctors, the medication wasn't working on me and crazy things were happening. I must confess that I was bipolar and an alcoholic, which aggravated the condition.\"\nIt\u2019s safe to say that those 18 months did give rise to severe competition, where many rappers established them and shelled out one hit after the other. However, Yo Yo Honey Singh\u2019s fans stayed loyal and waited patiently for their King of Rap to return and do so with a bang.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nyoutube\nLast year, he made everyone groove to his hit numbers Dil Chori Sada and Chote Chote Peg.

From immense support to valuable criticism, he holds his family responsible for everything. In an interview with TOI, he said,\n\u201cMy whole life and career is dedicated to my family. During my break around 2014, I wasn\u2019t able to compose music. There was a lot of support from my family at that time. I made a lot of songs during this period [that released and became hits in 2017-18]. My father is a great listener. He predicts very well whether a song will be a hit or not.\"\nNot just his family, his strongest pillar of strength, his life partner Shalini has been a constant support throughout his life. Talking about her, he said,\n\u201cMy wife and I have known each other for 17 years. She has been supportive throughout my bad phase, when even my family didn\u2019t know how to handle the situation. She is a brave lady and because of her, many things in my life have become splendid. She is a good critic as well. She does not always praise my songs,\u201d he concluded.\nyoutube\nWith such strong support from his family and loyalty from fans, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back for good and has some amazing projects in the works.\nWe hope to see him take charge and rule over the hearts of his fans like never before.", "title": "Yo Yo Honey Singh Owes It All To His Parents & Wife, Calls Them His Best Critics & Supporters", "date_publish": "08/04/2019, 18:43:39", "description": "The singer who illuminated the rapping genre of music in the hearts of Indian audiences, Yo Yo Honey Singh has seen it all - Humongous success followed by troubles so severe that he vanished away from the music scene with no certainty of a comeback.
