{"text": "Adah Sharma is one actress who proved her mettle with her first film 1920. But soon after 1920, we didn\u2019t see her much, obviously because she had no strong contacts or a KJo debut. Despite that, Adah Sharma is happy with her life and is infact excited about her film Moh, where she plays a girl who is facing depression.\nTwitter\nAn excited Adah, who was also seen in Hasee Toh Phasee, talks to Indiatimes about her film Moh and her journey in Bollywood so far.\nTalking about Moh, she said, \u201cWhen I was narrated the script, I was attached with the emotional journey, I thought its a fantastic emotional film for me to do, and equally challenging, I play this honest girl who is in depression and it shows how she got into depression. We show the reason because she was a happy girl who didn\u2019t care about what people used to tell about her, I think people are going to really like it.\u201d\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nTwitter\nWe quizzed her if she ever faced depression in real life and she said, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t faced depression. Of course, I have had my low moments on days, because you can\u2019t be happy 24/7, you want to be sad also, but I haven\u2019t felt depression\u201d\nTwitter\nTalking about how one can heal themselves from depression and Adah has some valid points after her movie, She said, \u201cI can say that those who are depressed, should outdo themselves from that situation and help others maybe. Visiting an old age home or helping animals may help them a lot. Of course you do need medical attention but one thing is important that when you are sad, low or depressed, don\u2019t think about yourself at that time and try and think outer of yourself and do something for somebody else.\u201d\nTwitter\nWe asked Adah if she ever gets insecure that other actresses are doing so well and getting powerful roles, and she replies,\n\u201cIt would be very wrong for me to say that someone is someone\u2019s daughter and that is why she got this or that role. I can crib about that or I can say that I actually started with a fantastic role and got appreciation for my first film which is 1920. After all, somebody who didn\u2019t know me at all trusted me and gave the film.\"\n\"I have done some great work down South also. I have Commando 2 which is one of the biggest action film franchise in our country. I think I am very lucky, instead of thinking that a particular role didn\u2019t come to me because she is some else's child. I am very grateful for what I got.\u201d\nWhen asked if she fears losing what she's achieved in such a short span of time and she has the most zen answer, \u201c Not at all, because I don\u2019t think I have anything to lose right now. At the moment, I am getting so much love, like recently, I wore a newspaper dress on a red carpet, I wore it because I liked it, and it was so heartening to see that people loved it too and thought it was cool. Basically, I don\u2019t do things to get love, I do it what I like.\"\nFurther continuing, she said,\n\u201cTalent you can never lose, no one can take that away from you, thankfully. It\u2019s only yours, and talking about love from people, I feel I will get it if I deserve it .\"\nTwitter\nAdah is extremely confident and positive, in fact she wants good directors to come to her rather than she having to ask for work, \u201c I am hoping filmmakers watch my films and think lets have her in our film, let\u2019s give her more opportunities, because she is talented and she can do everything. I want that to happen, I don\u2019t have small dreams of being launched by this person, , I want others to say wow, let\u2019s take Adah, because it\u2019s so nice to be on the set when somebody thinks you are really good.\u201d\nUndoubtedly, Adah is one focussed actress and she's definitely here to stay and slay!", "title": "Despite Not Being A Star Kid, Adah Sharma Is Confident No One Can Take Her Talent Away", "date_publish": "23/04/2019, 14:49:46", "description": "Adah Sharma is one actress who proved her mettle with her very first film 1920, she was outstanding in it.
