{"text": "3 months into 2019 and it is safe to say that this year is about self-liberation and freedom. While last year was about the #MeToo movement where people spoke about their shocking stories in professional set ups, this year has begun with #IAmNotOk\nTwitter\nAnd we're SHOOK with #IAmNotOk because people on social media are discussing about their traumatic lives which has been sending shivering down our spines. American actress Evan Rachel shared her story of self harm during her abusive relationship.\nTwitter\nIn a series of tweets, Westworld actress described the brutality she went through in the past with her abuser. From forcing her to make videos, smile at his inappropriate jokes and self harm, she has admitting to some upsetting events. Take a look.\nDon't Miss 106 SHARES 153 SHARES 282 SHARES 862 SHARES\n2 years into my abusive relationship\nI resorted to self harm. When my abuser would threaten or attack me, I cut my wrist as a way to disarm him. It only made the abuse stop temporarily. At that point I was desperate to stop the abuse and I was too terrified to leave. #IAmNotOk pic.twitter.com/VtZ1cA7JdB \u2014 #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 11, 2019\nThe day of this photoshoot, I was so weakened by an abusive relationship. I was emaciated, severely depressed, and could barely stand. I fell into a pool of tears and was sent home for the day. #IAmNotOk pic.twitter.com/aVUQ1w8ayQ \u2014 #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 11, 2019\n\"The day of this photoshoot, I was so weakened by an abusive relationship.

It was never safe to open up fully because I felt like they wouldnt understand, and I couldn\u2019t handle anymore shame or guilt. \u2014 #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019\n#IAmNotOk because when I was worried someone close to me was being abused, I was told to calm down and it was just \u201cmy trauma\u201d talking.\nBut it was my experience and wisdom talking. Hysteria comes when no one believes or listens to you. \u2014 #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019\nI hope #IAmNotOk encourages people to ask \u201cAre you ok?\u201d\nAnd empowers someone in an abusive situation to say\n\u201cI am not ok.\u201d And they wont have to say anything else. We\u2019ll know. \ud83d\udc9c \u2014 #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019\n#IAmNotOk because if you research how to leave an abusive relationship online, most websites have a quick exit button, in case your abuser catches you looking for a way out. \u2014 #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019\nAfter her story, many other people came out to share their sorrows.\n#IAmNotOk\nA loved one is in an abusive relationship. And it effects me. I am not physically in that home, but the abuser is powerful beyond walls \u2014 \ud83e\udd84BraveByDesign (@Marieluvunivers) March 14, 2019\nI didn't know how to get out. First lawyer I asked for help said that divorce would bankrupt me. He told me to work harder and save up some money and maybe I'd be able to leave in a few more years. He told me I had made a bad choice and needed to face the consequences #IAmNotOk \u2014 Katie (@ktkipper) March 13, 2019\nThe fact that I not only lived, but got out, is still miraculous to me. But even though I've done a lot of healing, #IAmNotOk and I'm not sure I ever will be again. \u2014 Katie (@ktkipper) March 13, 2019\n#IAmNotOk because being made to believe your feelings are invalid and irrational, to feel like you\u2019re always wrong and in the wrong, is no way to live in a relationship. Emotional abuse matters too \u2014 Eden Neidert (@edenrose95) March 13, 2019\n#IAmNotOk because I cannot snap out of this severe depression/chronic anxiety from the CPTSD as a result of the domestic abuse that he denies he did, or that it ever even occured. The only people that know the truth are my closest friends, and I pretend to the world that I am ok. https://t.co/TZeUzHXbfj \u2014 *Nameless Narrator* (@SlowBoiledFrog) March 13, 2019\n#IAmNotOk and sometimes when people get angry at me I am suddenly 8 years old again, being hit by a man twice my size that until then had groomed me into thinking he cared about me and was a loving and caring step father. \u2014 Beate (@beaterast) March 13, 2019\nMy ex tried to kill me twice. I testify this summer in his criminal trial. He verbally, mentally, financially, physically and emotionally abused me for years. One day I had enough and got out. I have perm scars and injuries from it. I have post-concussion syndrome. #IAmNotOk \u2014 Surviving Hell (@HellSurviving) March 13, 2019\nWe have all been a part of #IAmNotOk at some point of our lives. While some talk about it, some are still not ready but more power and love to those who have the courage to go out there and talk about their issues around domestic violence.", "title": "#IAmNotOk: 'Westworld' Actress Rachel Wood Opens Up About Self Harming During An Abusive Relationship", "date_publish": "14/03/2019, 12:59:27", "description": "After her episode, a lot of women have come to share their storiesAfter her episode, a lot of women have come to share their storiesAfter her episode, a lot of women have come to share their storiesAfter her episode, a lot of women have come to share their storiesAfter her episode, a lot of women have come to share their storiesAfter her episode, a lot of women have come to share their storiesAfte", "authors": ["Saloni Singh"], "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/iamnotok-westworld-actress-rachel-wood-opens-up-about-self-harming-during-an-abusive-relationship-363689.html\n", "image_url": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Mar/rachel_wood_1552544428_800x420.jpg"}
