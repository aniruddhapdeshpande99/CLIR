Bahl who was one of the founders of Phantom Films along with Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane, was removed from the list. Vikas was in the midst of directing Super 30 but lead actor of the film, Hrithik Roshan too chose to not work with him.\nAnd now with the film hanging in the middle, the other founder Anurag Kashyap has taken over to supervise the post production of the film.\n'According to a report in Huffington Post, Anurag will now take over the film. \u201cAt the moment I am getting Womaniya (now titled Bhains Ki Aankh) started, but yes, I will be overseeing the post-production of Super 30,\u201d Kashyap confirmed.\nTwitter\nAs the name suggests, there are about 30 new people making a debut with this film. This movie is about Anand Kumar, a Mathematics genius from a modest family in Bihar who makes sure that even the poor man can create some of the world's most genius minds.\nKashyap further said that he won't be taking any credits for his work on the film.
