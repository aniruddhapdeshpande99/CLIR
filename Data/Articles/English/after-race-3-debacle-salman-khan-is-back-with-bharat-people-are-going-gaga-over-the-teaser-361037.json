Salman Khan also had to bear the brunt for the same. And hence, for his next titled Bharat, he left no stone unturned to ensure it does not turn out to be a disaster like his last Eid release.\nTwitter\nFinally, the first teaser of Bharat, which also stars Katrina Kaif in the lead role is out, and people have gone berserk after watching it. In the Ali Abbas Zafar directoral, Salman Khan can be seen in different avatars. From a daredevil motorcyclist who is performing some breath-taking stunts to a Navy officer, Salman Khan can also be seen as an ageing boxer in the movie.\nMe, making different email IDs to get Free Netflix subscription for a month. #BharatKaTeaser pic.twitter.com/HFo2mlHvPL \u2014 SAGAR (@sagarcasm) January 25, 2019\nWithout further ado, watch the Bharat teaser below.\nDon't Miss 812 SHARES 3 K SHARES 699 SHARES 4 K SHARES 449 SHARES\nFans are going bonkers over the teaser.\nAmmazinnggg, terrific teaser i have ever seen in my life,\nAlways all time blockbuster #BharatKaTeaser #SalmanKhan #BharatEid2019 \u2014 mohammed sayed (@BeingHu69330864) January 25, 2019\n#BharatTeaser \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\nJeete Hai Shaan se #SalmanKhan Fan ke naam se\nWe Luv u @BeingSalmanKhan Till Our Lst Brth\nJAI SALMAN KHAN pic.twitter.com/lMGbcnxeiC \u2014 SHAHID S\u1d00\u029f\u1d0d\u1d00\u0274\u026as\u1d1b\u1d00\u0274 (@SSALMANISTAN) January 25, 2019\nIsko bolte hai Toofaan \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 another Blockbuster on its way\nJeete hai shaan se #SalmanKhan Fan ke naam se\nWe Luv u @BeingSalmanKhan Till Our Last Brth pic.twitter.com/rHbGxgBJGM \u2014 SHAHID S\u1d00\u029f\u1d0d\u1d00\u0274\u026as\u1d1b\u1d00\u0274 (@SSALMANISTAN) January 25, 2019\nJag Ghoomeya thaare jaisa naa koi :D\nJabardast ekdum #BharatkaTeaser _/_ \u2014 Its Raj..!
