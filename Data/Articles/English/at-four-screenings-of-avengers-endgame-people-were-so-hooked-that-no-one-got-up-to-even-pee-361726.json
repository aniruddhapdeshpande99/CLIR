But whatever happens, the Marvel universe will never be the same again.\n\u201cSome people move on. But not us,\u201d said the new trailer of Avengers: Endgame that was shared by Marvel studios, a few days ago. Of course, they didn\u2019t spill beans on the plotline, but it sure prepared us emotionally for another roller coaster ride.\nNow, building up the excitement even further, directors Joe and Anthony Russo have revealed that they organised test screenings for Avengers: Endgame. Russo Brothers said that the audience was so hooked to the movie that no one got up to even pee.\n\u201cWe have screened the movie four times for audiences now. For the first three screenings, not a single person got up to go to the bathroom,\u201d Anthony Russo was quoted as saying in an interview with Collider.\nWhat\u2019s more? They also hinted that the movie will be as long as three hours, but there is still more work to be done in the editing bay.\n\u201cI think the studio is down with what the best story is. Right now, we think the movie is playing well and we\u2019ve had great responses from our test audiences and we\u2019re feeling very good about where it is. We\u2019re still doing work to it. We\u2019re not done with it.\nDon't Miss 264 SHARES 2.5 K SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 130 SHARES\n\u201cAgain, this is a culmination film of 22 movies, it\u2019s a lot of storytelling to work into it. Emotion is an intrinsic part of that to us. When you have to tell a really complicated story and you want strong emotional moments with the characters, it just requires a certain amount of real estate. This one, in particular, feels like three hours worth of real estate.\u201d\nAvengers: Endgame is slated to hit the screens on April 26.
