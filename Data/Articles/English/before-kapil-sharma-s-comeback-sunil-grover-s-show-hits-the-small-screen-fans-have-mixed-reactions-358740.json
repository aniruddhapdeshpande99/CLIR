Rumours suggested that he has been in a rehab in Delhi and now he has stopped drinking. He came back to Mumbai and got married to his long-time girlfriend Ginni Chatrath.\nAnd he\u2019ll soon be back with his new show with Salman Khan and Ranveer Singh.\nDon't Miss 106 SHARES 346 SHARES 185 SHARES 764 SHARES\nMeanwhile, Sunil Grover who did a lot of live shows and also featured in movies like Patakha, is also back on TV with another show called Kanpur Wale Khuranas, which has already made its debut on Dec 15.\nWhile some people loved the fact that Sunil Grover is back on TV doing what he does the best, there were others who compared his performance to the roles he has done in his previous show.
