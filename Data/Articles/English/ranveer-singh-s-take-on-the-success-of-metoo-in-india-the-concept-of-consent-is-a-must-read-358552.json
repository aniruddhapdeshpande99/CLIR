He said that the movement has been very impactful in India and he hopes there is a change in the patriarchal thinking of Indian men.\nJust to jog your memory a little, the #MeToo movement hit India when Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of sexual misconduct while they were shooting for a song for their 2008 film 'Horn Ok Pleassss'. People like M J Akbar, Vikas Bahl, Alok Nath, Sajid Khan, Justin Das and, most recently, artist Subodh Gupta have been outed in India's #MeToo movement.\nRanveer was present at the Times Network India Economic Conclave 2018 on Thursday, where he gave two cents on the success of the movement in India.\nAgencies\n\"The #MeToo movement was historic, revolutionary. It has made guys take stock and think and, that itself, is a big thing. It has been hugely impactful and significant.\"\nRanveer added that whatever happened in the last two months was a revolution.

You had perpetrators who aren't working anymore. It made a huge impact from where I stand. In my perception, what the movement should have done, I think it has. It has changed to a large extent the way men think. Every man thinks twice, they are afraid. They think if they do something wrong, it is going to be called out. It had made a huge impact at the ground level.\"\nRanveer described his idea of consent and said that it's the thinking of men that need to change. He said,\nAgencies\n\"We have, for the longest time, lived in a patriarchal society. Men feel very entitled in their species, in my surroundings at least. Fortunately, I have had an upbringing, my father has always been out, so I was raised by four women, mother, sister, grandmother and great grandmother, so I have a different way of looking at it. I also studied in America where gender dynamics are very different, the outlook and view on sex is very different. I have had that kind of exposure. I have seen guys who have a sense of entitlement that is deeply ingrained in them and they laugh at you if you tell them otherwise.\"\nRanveer said he would like to lead by example in his life.\n\"I am hoping as a thought leader to contribute towards some positive change, by just leading in example, I am hoping I make some change. It's too slow moving,\" he said.\nSingh went on to add that what India really needs educational training in understanding the true meaning of consent. He added,\n\"These things have to start from foundational, fundamental level. Parents need to pass on to kids and schools to students. What you understand of the world and the interactions while growing up.\"\nSingh got married to his long-term girlfriend Deepika Padukone in Italy in November and is currently busy with the promotions of his upcoming film Simmba.\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "Ranveer Singh's Take On The Success Of #MeToo In India & The Concept Of Consent Is A Must-Read!", "date_publish": "14/12/2018, 11:52:53", "description": "Ranveer Singh on #MeToo in India: It Has Made Men Take Stock and Think Ranveer Singh said #MeToo movement has been very impactful in India and he hopes there is a change in the patriarchal thinking of Indian men.
