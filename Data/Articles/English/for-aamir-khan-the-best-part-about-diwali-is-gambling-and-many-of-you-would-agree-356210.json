From lighting diyas to attending Diwali card-parties to gambling, Diwali is a special festival for reasons more than one.\nFor Bollywood actor Aamir Khan, this year's Diwali is even more special as his film Thug Of Hindostan is all set for a nationwide release. But this isn't the only reason why Aamir is looking forward to Diwali. Aamir's wife and filmmaker Kiran Rao's birthday too falls on the same day. Talking to DNA, Aamir said,\nPinterest\n\"What I enjoy about Deepawali is being with my family. This year, it\u2019s even more special as it\u2019s my wife, Kiran\u2019s birthday. I hope this Diwali will be special, joyous and safe for everyone.\"\nCalling himself a 'reckless' gambler, Aamir talks about his fondness for it. He adds,\n\"What I like most about this festival is the gambling (laughs)! I\u2019m a reckless gambler. I love it but do it (play cards) only once during this time of the year. I like poker and I\u2019m looking forward to playing it.\"\nWell, a lot of you will surely relate to Aamir. Why is Diwali special for you?
