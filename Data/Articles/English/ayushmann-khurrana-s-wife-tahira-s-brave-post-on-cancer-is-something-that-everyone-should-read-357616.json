You show it the way out! It is a tough phase to be in, but then I would have never known my own strength, which is inherent in each one of us, and which we come to know off when tested. Like I said before, let\u2019s choose to be the heroes of our own drama of life. I strongly believe if an obstacle comes in your life it is for you to deal with it, overcome it, beat the shit out of it and become a better version of yourself, which could be a bit worn out but would be experienced, a bit tattered but more wise, a bit left out but more to bring forth, a bit handicapped but better equipped!\nSo now the upgraded version of myself is dealing with cancer stage 1 a, which is still a result of early detection. I\u2019ll be going through 12 sessions of chemotherapy. 6 down, and another 6 left. Hence the cap look nowadays.\nThis post is dedicated to my journey where half the battle is won and the other half I want to fight with each of you who is enduring it. Be resilient, be strong, we shall overcome and how! Also I have immense gratitude for people around me who have taken it in the right spirit and didn\u2019t give up on me.\"\nTahira and Ayushmann have two children, Virajveer and Varushka. In an interview with IANS, Ayushmann had opened up about his equation with Tahira and how happy he was to have her in his life. \"I am glad I have a partner like Tahira who is very brave, strong, who is an inspiration. I have started seeing life through a different prism.\"\nWe hope they both find light at the end of the tunnel.", "title": "Ayushmann Khurrana's Wife Tahira's Brave Post On Cancer Is Something That Everyone Should Read", "date_publish": "29/11/2018, 17:45:40", "description": "Tahira Kashyap, actor Ayushmann Khurrana\u2019s wife, has written about her cancer diagnosis in an Instagram post.
