Her recent film Badhaai Ho is earning her praises and this proves how good talent always manages to come to the spotlight.\nIn a recent media interaction, Neena Gupta said that the most substantial impact of the #MeToo movement, which took off in India following actress Tanushree Dutta\u2019s sexual harassment allegations against actor Nana Patekar, is that people now will be wary of engaging in misconduct \u2014 whether or not the movement continues.\nAsked if she feels the #MeToo wave will stay in India or whether it will die down, Neena told IANS here: \u201cSee, proving (an experience) is very difficult here. Right now, girls have got the strength to speak up, but those girls will say (take names) who have nothing to lose.\n\u201cGirls who have still something to lose, will not be able to say. But I think whether (the movement) stays or fizzles out, people will be wary of doing anything of this sort now.\u201d\nbccl\nThe #MeToo movement in India started after Tanushree in September recalled an unpleasant episode with veteran actor Nana Patekar from the sets of Horn OK Pleassss in 2008.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nAfter that, a slew of controversies surrounding Vikas Bahl, Chetan Bhagat, Gursimran Khamba, Kailash Kher, Rajat Kapoor and Alok Nath have emerged. Why did naming and shaming come so late in Bollywood?\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it is. That\u2019s how it works here. I say in conferences \u2018I think it\u2019s a curse to be born a woman in India, especially a poor woman\u2019. Being a poor woman is a curse\u2026 It gives me so much pain when I see them,\u201d she said.\nbccl\nNeena has been in the industry for over three decades and has featured in films like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, Utsav, Trikaal, Khalnayak, Mulk, Veere Di Wedding and The Last Colour.\nAsked if age is now detrimental for an actress\u2019 career in Bollywood, Neena agreed and said that after a certain age, they don\u2019t receive good offers.\nbccl\n\u201cThere are not many roles. I always say that, \u2018After a certain age, what is a woman\u2019s role? Taking care of the family and home. After that there is no role\u2019. When the society will change, I think we would have more roles on-screen.\u201d\nLast year, Neena was in the spotlight after she took to social media to ask for \u201cgood roles\u201d. She has now been frequently seen in films. Apart from Mulk and Veere Di Wedding this year, she has been seen in the latest release Badhaai Ho and will next be seen in commercial drama Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar.\n\u201cEarlier in these subjects, there were no big roles. We used to get small character roles. Now films are being made on solid and substantial roles,\u201d said Neena, who essays a 50-year-old pregnant woman in Badhaai Ho.\nThe film is about a couple that has a grown up son already, but they get set to become parents again.\nShe said the film is not only about breaking taboos, but about ageless love.\n\u201cIt is an important thing and I don\u2019t think anyone has ever spoken about this. The more I worked in the film, the more I realised that it is very important and is more than just \u2018hasi, mazaak (humour)\u2019,\u201d added Neena, who is the mother of popular designer Masaba Gupta, whom she had with legendary cricketer Vivian Richards.\nShe describes her own journey as a mother \u201cvery tough\u201d.\n\u201cMy journey was very tough. I had no money. Money is the most important thing, I have realised in this world. I didn\u2019t have a husband and relatives. So it was really tough, but the joy Masaba gave me\u2026 The joy of motherhood\u2026 She was a very good child she did not trouble me much. The joy she gave me was enough to go through anything,\u201d said Neena, who raised Masaba as a single mother.\nInputs From IANS", "title": "Neena Gupta Feels People Will Be Wary Regardless Of Whether #MeToo Movement Stays Or Not", "date_publish": "19/10/2018, 13:28:09", "description": "The most substantial impact of the #MeToo movement, which took off in India following actress Tanushree Dutta\u2019s sexual harassment allegations against actor Nana Patekar, is that people now will be wary of engaging in misconduct \u2014 whether or not the movement continues \u2014 says veteran actress Neena Gupta.
