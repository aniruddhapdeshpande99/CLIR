With films like Commando and Baadshaho, he proved his mettle too. He is loved by the audiences and already considered one of the best action hero in Bollywood.\nIn his next film titled Junglee, Vidyut Jammwal will apparently land in the world of animals.

It was amazing for me to extend my knowledge of Kalaripayattu by practicing animal flow. Most of the conventional exercises in the gym isolate only two muscles at a time. However, training like an animal functionally overcomes this one way to optimize strength, flexibility, mind-body control,\u201d he was quoted as saying by theindianwire.com.\n\u201cHumans are emotional beasts and hence face trouble in being in the moment. That is why we are not natural fighters like the leopard or the tiger who do not get paralyzed by fear. These animals do not get paralyzed by guilt situation. This awareness, apart from additional strength from animal flow helped me be at ease with the animals I shot with for \u2018Junglee\u2019. I was awed by the depth of this stream of martial arts and wanted to bring on the big screen with \u2018Junglee\u2019,\u201d he added.\nThe trailer is slated to release on March 6.", "title": "Vidyut Jammwal & His 'Junglee' Friends Will Take You On An Action-Packed Ride In The New Teaser", "date_publish": "28/02/2019, 12:29:22", "description": "In his next film titled Junglee, Vidyut Jammwal will apparently land in the world of animals.
