For those who grew up in the 90s exactly know what we're talking about. Seeing the animated version of Lion King was super special and now we have a full-fledged live action trailer of The Lion King.\nDisney/screengrab\nAfter their teaser, Disney released the trailer of their first live action remake of the movie after the success of The Jungle Book. The upcoming film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Billy Eichner, John Oliver, Keegan-Michael Key, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, and James Earl Jones.\nDisney/Screengrab\nThe movie journeys to the African savanna where a future king must overcome betrayal and tragedy to assume his rightful place on Pride Rock. Most people are looking forward to the movie thanks to Simba's adorable looks but some are extremely disappointed with the way Scar has been portrayed on-screen. From calling him malnutritioned to massacred, Internet is upset with the look of the Lion.

I\u2019m just wondering how we\u2019re supposed to tell these lions and lionesses apart when they all look like real animals. Scar isn\u2019t even darker or anything. He just looks like he got ran over by a truck. #NotMyScar \u2014 Alex (@Alexander_TG12) April 10, 2019\nDisney took the majestic being that is Scar and turned him into a ragged lion without luscious, dark mane. Just.... why. #NotMyScar \u2014 Erin Laidley (@eclaidley) April 10, 2019\nAlso I am just going to say it. This is #NotMyScar. I will forever call this lion \"Not Scar\" because I refuse to believe that Not Scar is actually the wonderful villain from the superior 1994 film. pic.twitter.com/t46faO1Qqm \u2014 T Y L \u018e R (@IntrepidMegan) April 10, 2019\nWTF I watched the new lion king trailer and bruhhh why\u2019d they do scar like that.
