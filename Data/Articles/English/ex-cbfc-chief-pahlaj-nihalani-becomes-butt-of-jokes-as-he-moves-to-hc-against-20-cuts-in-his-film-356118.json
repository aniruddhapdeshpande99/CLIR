He says he will take the matter to court.\nMoreover, he even ranted against the current CBFC Chief Prasoon Joshi.\n\u201cEverybody knows about Prasoon Joshi\u2019s enduring friendship with Aamir Khan. No one is surprised that Thugs Of Hindostan (starring Aamir Khan) was given an all-clear censor certification out of turn, while my film Rangeela Raja which was submitted well in time 60 days ahead of release, has been slapped with multiple cuts which I am not taking. No sir\u201d\nHe says the demands of the censor board are ABSURD. Yes, you read that right.\n\u201cThere is no vulgarity no double meaning dialogues. Still, I\u2019ve been asked to delete a massive number of dialogues and scenes. In one sequence my heroine asks my hero what he\u2019d like as guru dakshina. He says Eklavya cut his thumb and gave it to his guru, to which she tells the hero he can cut her lips. There is no kiss. Only a suggestion of a kiss. Still, I\u2019ve been asked to cut out this harmless playful scene. Why? Movies like Anurag Kashyap\u2019s Manmarziyan are filled with kissing and lovemaking scenes and yet passed with a UA,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Bollywood Hungama.\nDon't Miss 117 SHARES\nAnd since then he has become a butt of jokes on Twitter!\n#1\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nKisine bahut sahi kaha h.... isi janm me karmo ka fal mil jata h.#\u0917\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0938\u093e_\u0906\u0924\u093e_\u0939\u0948 #PahlajNihalani https://t.co/R2HXSaKeeJ \u2014 Bhuvanesh Sharma (@bhuvanhere) November 5, 2018\n#2\nKarma's a bitch, or as Pahlaj Nihalani would've 'modified', karma's a bad woman! https://t.co/5TJyojgPLe \u2014 kabir (@KabirTrivedi) November 5, 2018\n#3\n#4\nPahlaj Nihalani's reaction after Censor board suggests 20 cuts in Rangeela Raja pic.twitter.com/MiodsNysr1 \u2014 Batty (@MrBatty_) November 5, 2018\n#5\nWhen the chickens come home to roost \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 #PahlajNihalani https://t.co/CNf8UO9Kll \u2014 Nandini Sen (@nandinicsen) November 5, 2018\n#6\n#7\nGive him the idea to change the film name to Rangeela Popat. censor board will pass it \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude03 \u2014 Baba Rangeela Popot (@Popat_Patra) November 5, 2018\n#8\nAs you sow, so shall you reap! \u2014 Mahadev Parameswaran (@empeewarren) November 5, 2018\n#9\nIrony just died a thousand deaths \u2014 Rottun (@anshuzewan) November 5, 2018\nWell, somebody rightly said \u2013 Karma is a bi**ch!", "title": "Ex-CBFC Chief Pahlaj Nihalani Becomes Butt Of Jokes As He Moves To HC Against 20 Cuts In His Film", "date_publish": "05/11/2018, 18:00:09", "description": "Censor Board has reportedly ordered multiple cuts in his forthcoming film Rangeela Raja which stars Govinda in double role, and Pahlaj Nihalani is not ready to back off.
