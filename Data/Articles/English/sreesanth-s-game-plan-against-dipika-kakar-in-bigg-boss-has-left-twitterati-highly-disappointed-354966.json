{"text": "We have lost count of the times Sreesanth has wanted to quit Bigg Boss 12 and it's been just a month since the show aired. In last night\u2019s episode as well, he attempted to walk out of the house in anger. It\u2019s no surprise anymore that Sreesanth is the most aggressive contestant on the show and that he often loses his temper.\nHe was evicted from the show a few days ago, only to be kept in a secret room along with Anup Jalota. After having watched other contestants play the game and seeing their true and real side, Sreesanth is not only against Dipika Kakar, who he calls his elder sister, but is also plotting the entire game against her with the help of other contestants.\nThis, apparently, isn\u2019t going down well with the fans, who are calling out Sreesanth for playing a bad game on Twitter.\n#Sreesanth even now says that he wants to go home but when he was chosen by #DipikaKakkar, he blames her for choosing him. He is losing his self respect more and more by continuing the show. #BiggBoss #BiggBoss12 #BB #BB12 \u2014 Nikhil Reddy #MovieManiac (@sainikhilreddy7) October 16, 2018\n#Sreesanth - #BiggBoss mujhe ghar jana hai.
