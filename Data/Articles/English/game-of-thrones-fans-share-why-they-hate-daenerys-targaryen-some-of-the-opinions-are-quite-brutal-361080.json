{"text": "Unlike other characters in Game of Thrones, Daenerys Targaryen is a lot of things, like -- \u201cDaenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.\u201d\nIf Daenerys Targaryen was your colleague, you would hate her. She would make you work under her \u2013 that\u2019s what she did with Jon Snow too \u2013 and take all the credit in the end. We all have such colleagues, don\u2019t we?\nvia GIPHY\nAlso Read: 9 Insanely Convincing \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Season 8 Theories That Will Pump You Up For The Finale!\nWe\u2019re sure, you are not surprised at the fact that a lot of people dislike Daenerys Targaryen. She is one the most powerful women characters on the show, but if you ask people around yourself as to who are they rooting for to sit on the Iron Throne, nobody would take her name. It\u2019s a tough call between Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister, according to my friends.\nvia GIPHY\nSo, if you are also one of those who wonder why people don\u2019t want Daenerys Targaryen to take the Iron Throne, it is because people hate the character quite a lot. On this Reddit thread, people revealed as to why they hate her so much.\n#1 She is na\u00efve!\n\u201cShe's no where near my least favorite character on the show but I do find myself rolling my eyes at a lot of what she says and does. She's just very naive and entitled and while she fundamentally has good intentions for the people she intends to rule, she has no idea whatsoever on how to get them to actually want her to rule them. She also just sucks at ruling and the only reason she's accomplished anything is because she has dragons, not because she's particularly smart, cunning, or any of the traits the other successful characters of the show have,\u201d wrote a user OddishJihad.\nvia GIPHY\n#2 She is pretentious and arrogant.\n\u201cShe sits on Dragonstone and when Jon Snow arrives, she immediately asks him to bend the knee. The Starks were the insulted party, after all. She is the one that should have apologized to them in the name of her House,\u201d writes Mindless_Art.\nvia GIPHY\n#3 She is not the Aragorn - prototype like Jon.\n\u201cShe is a complex character that made a lot of mistakes and she is trying to learn. She is not the Aragorn - prototype like Jon. That's why she is hated,\u201d writes OnlyOneFeeder.\nDon't Miss 161 SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\nvia GIPHY\n#4 Her outlook is childish.\n\u201cShe has a very childish outlook on the world. She destroys entire cities and kills hundreds if not thousands because of a simple idea of \u201cslavery bad\u201d. In the books this is actually addressed, and Daenarys learns that you can\u2019t go around \u201c\u201d\u201dliberating\u201d\u201d\u201d slaves after Astapor is thrown into ruin and extreme poverty,\u201d writers user H1v3-m1nd.\nvia GIPHY\n#5 She is not really powerful.\n\u201cOne of the things that bothers me the most is the fake wind in her fake looking too perfect wig while she, or Emilia Clarke, is just having a blank face and the music starts to be so dramatic. She's portrayed as so \"powerful\", but she never really does anything apart from saying \"Dracarys\". It's mostly the way as they present her,\u201d writes Mariviere.\nvia GIPHY\n#6 She is only popular because of her dragons.\n\u201cThe only reason she is where she is at this point is because of the dragons. They are the reason she didn\u2019t die outside of Qarth, didn\u2019t die inside the Warlocks Tower, was able to free the Unsullied, survives the Fighter\u2019s Pit in Mereen, finally conquers the Slavers and also the reason why Queen\u2019s Army agrees to a truce. They are the reason she is able to save Jon and Jorah\u2019s crew. And she doesn\u2019t hesitate to use them to make people bow before her or strike fear in them, writes Betta45.\nvia GIPHY\n#7 She is rude and doesn\u2019t understand business.\n\u201cShe\u2019s rude to the 13 and doesn\u2019t understand business, and she\u2019s * surprised pikachu * that no one will help her without getting something in return,\u201d wrote a fan. \u201cAlso, willfully ignorant. Every time someone tries to teach her about the land she claims, she shuts them down,\u201d writes acrylicvigilante_.\nAny more reasons why you hate/love her? Tell us in the comments section below.
