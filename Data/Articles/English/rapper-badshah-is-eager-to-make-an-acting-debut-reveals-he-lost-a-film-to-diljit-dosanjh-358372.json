I have just become impatient after achieving success, otherwise, I am still the same. I was patient earlier but now I am not. I have a lot of ambitious, I want to do a lot of things, I am hungry for good work and I feel I have very less time to do so much and things aren\u2019t happening the way i want them to. But I don\u2019t have that air that I am star, sometimes I feel that I should feel like a star and throw tantrums but I genuinely can\u2019t do that. I feel what\u2019s the use of all this, if it won\u2019t benefit anyone.\u201d\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nBadshah even said he will now start doing hardcore rap as he wanted to do it since the beginning but wasn\u2019t able to so because he was building an empire for himself,\n\u201cI love party music, but I also like hardcore rapping. Somewhere I become greedy because I want to earn money. I have also opened a production house and I need money for that as well. But now I have decided that my next song is going to be very hardcore, if anyone wants to listen they will and others who don't have a taste for such music won't.
