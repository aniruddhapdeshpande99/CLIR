{"text": "\"Even Leonardo DiCaprio would have done this role.\" Nawazuddin Siddiqui announces amid controversies surrounding his upcoming film. When we meet him, he's wearing turquoise green shirt under a waistcoat, dressed to look more than Gaitonde (Ganesh) from Sacred Games than Bal Thackeray, the role that he's talking about.\nIndiatimes\nThe movie has been running from one controversy to another, the liberals are angry because the larger consensus is, Nawazuddin the poster boy for new Indian cinema is getting dragged into a propaganda movie on Bal Thackrey. For a brief while, others were angry that a Muslim was playing Bal Thackrey and somewhere a handful people are still convinced Amitabh Bachchan, thanks to Sarkaar, would have done a better job. Somewhere between the three is Nawazuddin. There is some merit to the glorification accusation, the movie is written and directed by MNS leader Abhijit Panse.\n\u201cPersonally I feel everyone has the right to speak their mind and they spoke, so it\u2019s good... but all I can say is you can\u2019t be judgmental by seeing just a two-minute teaser. First see the film and then decide,\" he says staring out of the window at Juhu beach. He's four floors up, looking down at a city where he first came in the film industry, worked as a security guard before landing a movie job. But even though that's behind him, there is a regret: \u201c I am not a star, aaj bhi meri film log dekhne nahi jaate hai.\u201d He is still upset with Manto and Raman Raghav not doing well.\nInstagram\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning for me.

This is my journey, earlier I used to do theatre, and if tomorrow I stop getting films, I will do a solo performance, or make a group of 10 people and play in front of your doorstep and everywhere in the world. I just love the process of film making and theatre, this is important for me, I cannot do a film on the basis of audiences, then I won\u2019t do justice with the characters I play.\u201d\nCouldn\u2019t afford to lose the opportunity to play Thackeray, Nawaz confesses of being in constant fear if he would pull off Thackeray on-screen, \u201cIt was the toughest role for me, I was in the constant fear that I should become his caricature, I have not tried to copy him. I have just tried to give his impression. And if you see in all the world\u2019s best biopics, be it Lincoln, Mandela or Gandhi, all the actors have tried to give the impression of the characters\".\nThe actor who leaves you spellbound with his each and every appearance in a film or web series, says, he is not a satisfied actor and that helps him grow,\n\u201c If you are satisfied then the possibilities of you growing as an actor stops. If I will get satisfied then I will start feeling ki mai Mahaan hu, Mai Mahaan nahi banana chahta. I want to be a student always when we used to work in theatres, we used to work in a group and discuss even the small scenes, and I want to continue to work like that. If I start feeling ki mai bada ban gaya , fir toh hogaya\u201d.\nInstagram\nNawaz's hunger and respect for his work is a reminder to many actors who wish to make it big and sustainable in the industry.
