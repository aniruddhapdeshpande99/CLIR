Come on, if the minute you open your eyes in the morning and don\u2019t reach out for your phone to surf the internet, then you my friend, are a misfit in this world! Moving on, I think it\u2019s also necessary that we take a minute to praise the creativity that we witness almost everyday on the internet.\nGod bless those strangers who sit in front of their screens and come out with some rib-tickling content in the form of tweets, memes and jokes. If only these memes paid off, those meme-makers would be millionaires by now. The best part is that there is hardly anything that escapes their scrutiny. Now that the year has come to an end, it\u2019s time we retrospect and curate the best memes that 2018 gave us. Scroll!\n#1 It would be a sin to not start this list with 'The Wink'!
