{"text": "\u201cAm shocked to find my name on the poster of this film. Have not written any songs for it!\u201d \u2013 when Javed Akhtar tweeted this yesterday, it stirred up a storm on Twitter.\nguiltfree.online\nSince the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s biopic has been announced, it is making headlines for some or the other reason. First, it was because of the trolls on social media after the poster starring Vivek Oberoi was released, and then when the trailer was out, it yet again became the butt of jokes.\nYesterday, Javed Akhtar slammed the filmmakers clarifying that despite the fact his name appears in the credits, he has not written any song for the movie.\nAm shocked to find my name on the poster of this film.

Shows the desperation of Bhakts https://t.co/CZxfoYfauQ \u2014 Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1) March 22, 2019\nAnd today, lyricist Sameer also raised his voice to deny his association with the film as well. \u201cAfter reading his tweet, I called Javed saab to tell him that I too was not approached by the filmmaker or the production house to work on the biopic. I haven't written any song for the movie. I don't understand what they are crediting me for,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Mid-day.\nTwitter\nOn the other hand, producer of the film Sandip Ssingh has clarified that the makers have used their old songs in the movie.\n\u201cWe have taken the songs 'Ishwar Allah' from the film '1947:Earth' and the song 'Suno Gaur Se Duniya Walon' from the film 'Dus' in our film, thus we have given the due credits to respective lyricists Javed Sahab and Sameer Ji. @TSeries is our Music partner,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nWe have taken the songs 'Ishwar Allah' from the film '1947:Earth' and the song 'Suno Gaur Se Duniya Walon' from the film 'Dus' in our film, thus we have given the due credits to respective lyricists Javed Sahab and Sameer Ji. @TSeries is our Music partner. @ModiTheFilm2019 \u2014 Sandip Ssingh (@sandip_Ssingh) March 23, 2019\nReacting to this, Sameer says, \u201cEven if the makers have used any of my old songs, the music label should be aware. But in this case, they too are clueless. On my part, I tried calling Omung Kumar and Sandeep Ssingh [producer], but their phones were switched off. What they have done is incorrect. They need to rectify it soon.\"\nTwitter\nWe have seen people not getting the credits for their work in the past. Kangana Ranaut and Apurva Asrani have had war of words in the public domain.
