Because they portray these roles in the cinematic world, and that these characters aren\u2019t real?\nvia GIPHY\nWhy stating the obvious, you ask? Because some people think that these characters exist in the real world. No, we are not talking about your niece/nephew or the kid that lives next door in his/her bubble. We are talking about grown-ups. For instance, DONALD TRUMP.\nvia GIPHY\nTalking about The US President Donald Trump, did you know that he recently brought Google under the scrutiny because when people like you and me searched for \u201cidiot\u201d on the search engine, his name would pop up.\nWhy would that happen? Just so unfair, right? Did someone hack Google or what? People had so many questions.\nSo, undoubtedly, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had to be questioned on that to make sure that \u201cit's not some little man sitting behind the curtain figuring out what we're going to show the users.\u201d\nvia GIPHY\nWell, that\u2019s another story for some other time maybe. But what caught our attention recently was that Christian Bale who played the role of Batman, talked about his experience meeting with Donald Trump in 2011.\nhearstapps.com\nDon't Miss 257 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\nRead carefully to what he said at the red carpet for the premiere of his upcoming political comedy Vice.\n\u201cWe were filming on Batman in Trump Tower and he said, come on up to the office. I think he thought I was Bruce Wayne because I was dressed as Bruce Wayne. So he talked to me like I was Bruce Wayne and I just went along with it, really. It was quite entertaining,\u201d he said.\ncdn.vox-cdn.com\n\u201cI had no idea at the time that he would think about running for president,\u201d Christian Bale was quoted as saying by Variety.\nvia GIPHY\nBut aren\u2019t we all living in a world which goes beyond our expectations? I mean, even we didn\u2019t know a Chai Wala would someday become our Prime Minister. Who would have thought that! In life, expect the unexpected.
