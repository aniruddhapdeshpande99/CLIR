{"text": "Right now, everyone is talking about how fabulous and outstanding Vicky Kaushal\u2019s Uri is. But apart from Vicky, there is another actor\u2019s work which is also being appreciated and applauded, and it is none other than Yami Gautam.\nThe actress who made a debut with Vicky Donor has made some bad choices like Sanam Re, but today she is in a good space. Yami is extremely happy after Uri worked in her favor.\nIndiatimes met the actress and had a heart to heart conversation with her. Firstly she began with the interview expressing her happiness over Uri\u2019s success, \u201cI knew it\u2019s a good film, we knew we are a part of something big; you get to know the energy of the film from day one.\u201d\nDon't Miss 233 SHARES 870 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES\nYami who plays the role of an intelligence officer, shared an anecdote, \u201c We had an army screening, and one army officer walked to me and said, \u2018Mam you are absolutely believable as an intelligent officer, that\u2019s how our female officers are in the department,\u2019 well, this is a true validation for me.\u201d\nInstagram\nWe asked if she feels Uri will be a game changer for her and she said, \u201c I want to do films where I have something substantial to do, and I am hoping there will be more such exciting roles coming up to me, I am very thankful to Aditya (director of Uri) to look beyond the stereotypical banner. I have been given the tag of girl next door, very sweet and beautiful girl who does love stories, I don\u2019t want any image, but if it all I am called the quintessential girl next door, because despite that Aditya saw me beyond that image and gave me Uri, which is a very different dimension.\u201d\nTwitter\nShe further added,\n\u201c I am hoping some very strong and powerful roles come my way. I am not restricted to any genre, especially in today\u2019s times, I would love to be a part of something which are not replaceable which you don\u2019t think, so and so could have done it. I want to do a role where I can be irreplaceable, I want to do justice with every role. And with every role you still feel you are proving yourself, especially being an outsider, it\u2019s not easy to get good roles, it\u2019s not easy to get work which resonates from the kind of work you want to do.\"\nOn doing lesser films, Yami defended herself saying she doesn\u2019t want to do films just for the sake of it, \u201c I don\u2019t believe in working on something which I don\u2019t have my heart in, it\u2019s very unfair. I am not saying every film of mine has done well, there are films which haven\u2019t done well, but there must be a reason behind signing it, so I will never disrespect that decision.\u201d\nInstagram\nHowever she admitted there have been failures in her career and she doesn\u2019t disrespect that,\n\"There could be some films where you watch and feel this is not something you wanted to do, because when you see a film in totality, you get to know what\u2019s the problem. I won\u2019t take the names of those films, but I have felt that it could have been something else, but that time, it\u2019s a vision of the director and I can\u2019t do anything about it, I have to believe in that vision, but that\u2019s fine, cinema is the director\u2019s vision.\u201d\nInstagram\nYami even highlighted why it gets difficult for an outsider to survive,\n\u201c Why I say it is difficult for an outsider because when your film does well, there are broader options for you and if your film doesn\u2019t do well, then it gets difficult and you have to make the best choice out of what is offered. \u201c\nInstagram\nBollywood is becoming more and more competitive, there are new talents coming every day, we asked Yami how insecure or secure she is, seeing this rapid change,\n\"You are right there are lots of competition, I will put it as contemporaries, there is a lot of talent, they all look good, they all are fit, polished and groomed. When we came, we weren\u2019t like this, I look back at those bad pictures of mine and say what was I thinking, but that also has its own novelty and charm. I don\u2019t feel insecurity is a healthy emotion. Also it\u2019s human to get bogged down for a second on what\u2019s happening around you, but you have to immediately pull up yourself and tell yourself that you are here for a reason, believe in that and go with your gut. I will never be successful if I get affected by others success and good work. I really feel it\u2019s important to be happy in life.\u201d\nInstagram\nShe even spoke about her life in Mumbai\n\"Life in Bombay any which ways is very fast, you don\u2019t even get to know, 'kab subah hui aur kab shaam', so when will you get time to enjoy for yourself, I am not trying to be philosophical, I am just trying to say that it\u2019s very important to have a healthy mind because this is a very exhausting place, and it can really consume you if you don\u2019t have your mind under control and then you won\u2019t be able to make a right decisions out of an insecure mind.\u201d\nInstagram\nBut Yami has a stress buster in her family, \u201cWhen my family is in Bombay, it\u2019s a party for me and when they are not there, I watch my favorite shows, like Friends, no matter if I have watched it for 1000 times, I will laugh on the same jokes, I will watch Andaz Apna Apna, that\u2019s my favourite film, I do anything that makes me happy, or I will cook some dessert, cooking is very therapeutic for me.\u201d\nInstagram\nWe concluded the interview by asking her favourite film in recent times and she said, \u201cI would love to do a female version of Andhadhun\u201d. Clearly, Ayushmaan Khurrana is giving his co-stars some major role goals.", "title": "With Uri\u2019s Success, Yami Gautam Is Hopeful To Get Powerful Roles And Become Irreplaceable", "date_publish": "15/01/2019, 16:27:18", "description": "The actress who made a debut with a film like Vicky Donor has made some bad choices like Sanam Re, but today is in a good space.
