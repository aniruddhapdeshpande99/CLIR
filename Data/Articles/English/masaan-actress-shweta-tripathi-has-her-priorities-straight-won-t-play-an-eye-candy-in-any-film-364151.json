{"text": "Shweta Tripathi is a perfect example of big surprises in a small package. She left everyone stunned with her outstanding debut in Masaan and since then she has been proving her mettle as an actress par excellence.\nTwitter\nShweta visited our office and was extremely excited to chat with us about her upcoming film Gone Kesh. While taking the tour of our office, she said, \u201cI was an employee with Times, I have worked in Femina\u201d.\nShweta sat in our conference room for an interaction where we first congratulated her for her brilliant performance in Made In Heaven, she has a small but an impactful part, we asked how she chooses her roles, to which she said, \u201cChoosing roles is seriously not a conscious decision, woh ho jaata hai because of my upbringing. We have been two sisters and I am sure agar brother sister hota tab bhi upbringing wahi hoti where we were never made to feel not equal. We were never told that aisi koi cheez hai which boys can do and girls can't, be it even staying out overnight or drinking, we were always open. For my parents, the most important thing was education, even today my dad calls me up and has two standard questions for me- first is, which book are you reading and the second one is, did you exercise or not, that is it. They have never been worried about, how much money I am making, or what is my starting salary, so I think when your foundation is right it just helps you with the bigger picture.\u201d\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nInstagram\nWe then asked her if the length of the role matters to her, she replied,\n\u201cI have never cared about how small or big my role is, I don\u2019t bother if I have one dialogue, one hour role or the whole web series, what matters is what you do in that time given to you, even in Made In Heaven, I just had an episode, I really didn\u2019t have any hang-ups and thoughts as to, abhi tak toh mai school girl play kar rahi hu and suddenly I am playing a bride. All this doesn\u2019t cross my mind. I want to focus on performance, even for Gone Kesh when people saw my poster, they said it\u2019s very bold and risky, I felt lucky that I got an opportunity, you can count in Bollywood and Hollywood that how many actors have got such posters, also I think I am looking amazing, people told me ki aise lag rahe ho, I was like but in my eyes I am looking very good, I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t like it. \u201c\nShweta reveals even she had a typical image for Bollywood, where everything was all about yellow farms and a heroine running in it, \u201cWhen I started acting obviously Bollywood for me was yellow khet, yellow churidar with dupatta, but then you realize there is so much more to it, of course, that is also fun and the kind of audience and popularity that you will have from that is great, but now when I look back and have these conversations and think about Masaan, Haramkhor, Mirzapur, I feel happy\u201d.\nTwitter\nShe further added, \u201cI think there should be a balance between both, because commercial cinema helps to bring you popularity, any wise actor would like to strive balance between the both, I would love to do performance driven role, but sometimes I would love to do light-hearted film, because all my films are very emotionally draining.\u201d\nTwitter\nWe asked her if she would ever do a film which has big stars but somewhere the content is not strong, she firmly said NO,\n\u201cNo chance, Khan or no Khan, if there is no content, it doesn\u2019t interest me, no matter how much money I am getting, no matter how big banner it might be, usme maza hi nahi hai, I am here because I love acting and if I am getting to perform then no. Eye candy is something that I cannot be.\u201d\nInstagram\nWe were intrigued to know how did her perception of Bollywood films changed, to which she shared an anecdote, \u201c I remember this incident very clearly, I was shooting for Kya Mast Hai Life, my first big acting gig, I used to travel by a regular cab and the same driver, I had no problem with that cab driver, amazing guy, full of respect, one day we were going on location and our car stopped at the signal beside a bus which had a movie poster of three women wearing their bikinis and swimsuits, and this driver was just looking at it, he wasn\u2019t staring in a bad way, but he was constantly looking at it, and then immediately I had a thing that I never want to be that person, I don\u2019t want people to look at me like that, or I don\u2019t want to be in a movie or a trailer because, \u2018oh wow look what she is wearing or looking\u2019, I wanted people to come to watch me purely on my talent.\u201d\nThe actress will be seen next in Gone Kesh and the trailer of the film is already winning hearts.", "title": "Masaan Star Shweta Tripathi Has Her Priorities Straight, Won't Play An Eye Candy In Any Film", "date_publish": "23/03/2019, 12:04:57", "description": "Shweta Tripathi is a perfect example of big surprises comes in small package.
