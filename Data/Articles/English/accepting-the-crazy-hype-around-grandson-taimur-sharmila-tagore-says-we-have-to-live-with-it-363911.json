She said that the only way she and her family could have dealt with media\u2019s obsession with grandson Taimur Ali Khan was by accepting it.\nThe two-year-old son of Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor is always surrounded by a bunch of paparazzi and his photos regularly go viral.\nOn Sunday, interacting with the media at the HELLO! Hall of Fame Awards 2019, the 74-year-old former silver screen queen said,\nDon't Miss 707 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES\n\u201cI suppose we have to live with it. This is the age of social media. I don\u2019t think anything can be done about it.\u201d\nShe has figured an apt way of dealing with it all. She feels if one cannot beat the trend then one should join it. However, she is also apprehensive. She feels the excessive media coverage is not good for Taimur as he is too small to deal with it.\n\u201cI am very old-fashioned. I don\u2019t think children should be exposed to all this. However I learnt from Sara (Sara Ali Khan, Taimur\u2019s half-sister) to say if you can\u2019t beat them, then join them,\u201d she told the media.\nTaimur\u2019s pictures regularly feature on Page 3. He catches more eyeballs apparently than any actor\u2019s kid of the film industry. When asked what Sharmila felt about that, she said\n\u201cI guess I should be happy about it but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very good for the child.\u201d\n(Also read: Looking At Taimur's Popularity In India, Kareena Might Consider Sending Taimur To A Boarding School)\nRecently, Kareena had spoken to PTI and she also reacted to the whole Taimur craze. A report quoted her as saying,\n\"We view it as something socially irresponsible because we have been such good parents, we haven't shied away, we never hid Taimur's face. In Hollywood, they don't allow children's faces to come (publish). But because Saif and I took the modern approach, we can't do that. He would think 'what is happening?' I don't want him to grow up in that fear. I want him to grow up and fly, that's what parents want their children to do. I can't keep him away.\"\n(Also read: Kareena Kapoor Feels Hiding Taimur's Face Would Scar Him More, Asks Paps To Be More Responsible)\nOn the other hand, Daddy Saif had a rather calm take on it. When he was asked if the attention around Taimur worries him, he said,\n\"I can only hope he\u2019ll take it as it comes and develop a certain humility. Like Taimur, I too am lucky to be born a Pataudi, go to Winchester College, get work in the industry when there were others who were brighter and more talented. It was a privilege whose worth I didn\u2019t understand then. Hopefully, my son will be more conscious and conscientious. There\u2019s something special about him. During the day, he\u2019s waddling around the house, but in the evening, when I dim the lights, light the candles, put on some music, he\u2019s happy to sit quietly with Kareena and me, drinking his milk, soaking in the ambience. As a parent I can only nurture him.\"\n(Also read: Kareena Kapoor Says \u2018There\u2019s A Looming Guilt\u2019 On Leaving Taimur At Home And Going To Work!)", "title": "Accepting The Crazy Hype Around Grandson Taimur, Sharmila Tagore Says 'We Have To Live With It'", "date_publish": "18/03/2019, 17:25:52", "description": "For the first time ever, Taimur's paternal grandmother and Veteran actress Sharmila Tagore has reacted to the crazy hype that paps have created around him.
