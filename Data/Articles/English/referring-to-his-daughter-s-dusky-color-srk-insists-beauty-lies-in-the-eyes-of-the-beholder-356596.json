He's one of those few actors who rose from scratch.\nHe's not just a celebrated actor but is also known for his heart warming nature towards colleagues, media persons and fans in his personal life. Being the superstar that he is, SRK gets embroiled into controversies pretty often too.\nThis time around, SRK was speaking about fairness creams and the constant debate around it. Speaking to Delhi Times, he said,\n\"Well, if I can smell a little honest beneath all that's public about me, then trust me, I've never tried to be dishonest with anyone. I mean, who am I to do so? I was never the best looking guy, the tallest person, the most able-bodied person, the best dancer, the guy with the nicest hair, not from a fine lineage and I did not come from an acting school that taught me to be a Hindi film hero. So how can I belittle someone on any of these seven-eight aspects?\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 106 SHARES 282 SHARES 325 SHARES\nMy wife, my children, I are all normal people and by saying so, I would be abusing my entire family. I'm a lower middle-class guy with none of these trappings. The only thing that must have worked for me is honesty. But look at me now; because of my stardom, I'm good looking also; I've become a poster boy! What joke is that? I used to have posters of Cheryl Ladd and Clint Eastwood in my room.\nI never thought main Cheryl Ladd ban jaunga toh main Clint Eastwood ban jaunga. That aspect was never a part of my life. I'll be honest; my daughter is sanwli, but she's the most beautiful girl in the world. And nobody can tell me otherwise.\"\nDespite endorsing Fair and Handsome, King Khan has a way with words and surely knows how to win hearts. This was one of the most honest things he revealed about his life and also the most beautiful.", "title": "Referring To His Daughter's Dusky Color, SRK Insists Beauty Lies In The Eyes Of The Beholder", "date_publish": "13/11/2018, 17:18:39", "description": "He's not just a celebrated actor but is also known for his heart warming nature towards colleagues, media persons and fans in his personal life.
