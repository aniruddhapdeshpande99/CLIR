Many people feel that I want to enter politics but that's not true. There are few actors in our industry like Ranbir Kapoor where he has been seen talking in an interview that 'We have regular supply of water and electricity at my home so, why should I comment about politics?' But I feel because of this country's people you are living in your luxurious home and you are travelling in your Mercedes so, how can you talk like that? This is irresponsible behaviour and I am not that kind of person.\"\n\"There has to be a war against terror, not against a country, religion, religions or between religions.
