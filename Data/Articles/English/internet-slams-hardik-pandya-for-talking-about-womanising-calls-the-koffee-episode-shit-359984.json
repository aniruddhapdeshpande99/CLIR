{"text": "This is the year on Koffee With Karan with a season of many firsts. From a lot of debutantes making their debut on KJo's show, there was a cricketer special episode as well. Yesterday, Cricketers Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul\u2019s made their debut on Koffee With Karan debut and sadly, the show has backfired and how.\nStar India\nThe episode hasn't gone down too well with the audience as when they were asked to choose the better batsman among Indian skipper Virat Kohli and master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, both chose Virat over Sachin. A fan wrote,\nStar India\n\u201cI mean, are you guys who say Virat is better than Sachin really cricket fans or mere accountants? B***** one straight drive by Sachin is more beautiful and valuable than any shot ever hit by Virat\u201d\nThat's not all.\nFans were also shocked by Hardik Pandya's views on womanizing and more.\nHere is the internet's verdict on last night's episode.\nA thread on all the creepy, misogynist, racist, and problematic things Hardik Pandya said on Koffee With Karan:\n1) KJo: Why don't you ask women's names at nightclubs?\nHP: I like to watch and observe how they move. I'm little from the Black side so I need to see how they move. \u2014 Sreeparna Mazumder (@Sreeep) January 6, 2019\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n#HardikPandya n #KLRahul\nFools they are.\nNo doubt #Virat is a good player but #Sachin is always on top on any day.

He's the GOD. He's an emotion. Bigger than Cricket. The undisputed no.1 GOAT!\nThat's it. That's the tweet.#KoffeeWithKaran #KoffeeWithCricketers \u2014 R I D D H I T (@Nadan_Parindey_) January 6, 2019\nHardik Pandya and KL Rahul on #KoffeeWithKaran happened to be the most cringe-worthy episode. #KoffeeWithCricketers was pure SH*T in a coffee mug. \u2014 Anoop Tomer (@anooptomer) January 7, 2019\nAfter watching today's episode of #KoffeeWithKaran, it's not hard to understand why cricket isn't cool anymore. #KoffeeWithCricketers \u2014 MSD7782 (@msd7782) January 6, 2019\n#KoffeeWithCricketers was just the worst episode. What's up with all the #misogyny . Tired of this boys will be boys attitude. @klrahul11 @hardikpandya7 #KoffeeWithKaran \u2014 Ekta Chauhan (@ekta2993) January 7, 2019\nWatched #KoffeeWithCricketers\nAnd I must say #HardikPandya is one pathetic, over-rated guy. He tries too much to be cool but he is not at all. Neither he is good looking nor a good human being.\nOn the other hand @klrahul11\nIs a true gentleman. \u2014 vinay pandey (@feelvinay) January 6, 2019\n#KoffeeWithCricketers Hardik Pandya should be dropped. He thinks he's West Indian. Some people cant handle money and fame. Sick. \u2014 pranit malik (@pranitmalik) January 6, 2019\n#KoffeeWithCricketers was just the worst episode.
