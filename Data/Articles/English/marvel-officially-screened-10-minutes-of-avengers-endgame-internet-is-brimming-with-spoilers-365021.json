{"text": "Unless you have been living under a rock, you must have heard about the crazy fandom for Marvel\u2019s Avengers: Endgame, the movie which will conclude about 20 movies of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It\u2019s hard and stupid to miss this one, to be honest.\nAP\nThe frenzy of the Avengers: Endgame is such that the pre-ticket sales have set a record already. People are re-selling the tickets on eBay for almost Rs 6,35,260. Don\u2019t believe us? Read this.\nAFP\nWhat will happen in the movie, everyone is wondering, but some of the people have already watched it. Not entirely, of course, but just 10 minutes of it. No, it hasn\u2019t been leaked. Ten minutes of Avengers: Endgame was screened for the press head of the film\u2019s Los Angeles press junket on Friday.\nBCCL\nThe reactions are ecstatic. People have given it an 'A plus' rating. What\u2019s more? The spoilers are all over the internet.\nI am f r e a k i n g o u t and I can\u2019t even tell you why... \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude05 #AvengersEndgame pic.twitter.com/NBeDVfh1qf \u2014 Tiffany Mink (@minkus) April 6, 2019\nOk. Ok ok. So I saw two (mind you short) scenes from @Avengers on the Lot today for an event for @Attractions. Couldn\u2019t have been more than 8 minutes of footage. And I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN I EVEN DID BEFORE. \u2014 Tiffany Mink (@minkus) April 6, 2019\nDon't Miss 2.5 K SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 130 SHARES 289 SHARES\nIf this opening scene is playing out how it LOOKS like it\u2019s playing out. Yo. I can at least say this- in the span of less than that 8 minutes, I went from actual crying to cheering. This thing is going to be W I L D. #avengersendgame \u2014 Tiffany Mink (@minkus) April 6, 2019\nY\u2019ALL REALLY TRYING TO START OFF THE MOVIE LIKE THAT?!?!?!?!?!\n*insert character related gif that I can\u2019t spoil* #avengersendgame \u2014 Tiffany Mink (@minkus) April 6, 2019\nI have now screened #AvengersEndgame footage and all I can say is that you are not prepared for what's coming.

The first 5 minutes was what appeared to be the beginning of the movie and the second 5 minutes was what I had previously seen at #CinemaCon. Not allowed to say anything specific but if I had to grade the footage A+ pic.twitter.com/tgSYMU1kKy \u2014 Steven Weintraub (@colliderfrosty) April 6, 2019\nWe saw about 6-7 minute of Avengers Endgame. One part was the CinemaCon footage, another wasn\u2019t, both left my dying to see more and with a million more questions. Some of which I can ask this weekend. \u2014 Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) April 6, 2019\nJust finished screening some of the footage from #AvengersEndgame!The Russo\u2019s showed us 2 clips. Loved what I saw. I\u2019m 10x times more excited for the movie now pic.twitter.com/YXKlDOqw6x \u2014 Dorian Parks (@DorianParksnRec) April 6, 2019\nI saw some #AvengersEndgame footage tonight. I\u2019d rather let you see it for yourself than describe it in detail. It was simultaneously tragic and sweet. I\u2019m beyond impressed and I\u2019ve got even more questions now than I had going in. Can\u2019t wait to see the rest! pic.twitter.com/aOQRBfZLBO \u2014 Sean Gerber (@MrSeanGerber) April 6, 2019\nOf course, Marvel is not screening the entire film ahead of the release, just like they didn\u2019t screen Avengers: Infinity War. During his visit to India, director Joe Russo appealed to the audiences to not reveal the spoilers after they have watched the movie. He said that keeping the plot of the film under wraps is very important, and hence, he didn\u2019t even answer any questions related to the plot.\nHowever, GameSpot has offered some concrete details after having watched 10 minutes of the movie. Of course, we are not going to spoil it for you. But discussions on Twitter are on!\nYou are not prepared for what\u2019s coming, are you?
