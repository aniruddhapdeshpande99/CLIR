Soon after, the wave spread over in India.\nFormer actress Tanushree Dutta put allegations on Nana Patekar on sexual harassment grounds and since then, there has been no looking back. Whether it's A-listers, regional cinema stars, TV stars or regular people like us, everyone came out to share their stories.\nAfter months of creating an uproar in the film fraternity, south Indian superstar feels the movement all this while was a fad. Speaking at press conference in Dubai, the actor said,\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 106 SHARES 282 SHARES 862 SHARES\n\u201cThere\u2019s no big problem in the Malayalam industry. You shouldn\u2019t think of the #MeToo as a movement actually. It\u2019s a fad and it\u2019s turning into something of a fashion. Anything like that will have a lifespan for a bit,\u201d the actor said at a press conference in Dubai on Monday.\n\u201cIt (sexual harassment) can happen anywhere in life, not just in films,\u201d he added.\nSoon enough, in an exclusive with Gulf News, he tried to neutralise the issue and further said,\n\"We (men) can also come out with a #MeToo, gender-wise. I cannot make a comment on that. Only when you experience something like that, you can make a comment on it. Just giving a comment on it isn\u2019t the right thing. I don\u2019t know much about it (#MeToo).\u201d", "title": "Malayalam Superstar Mohanlal Gives #MeToo Movement His Own Definition, Calls It A 'Fad'", "date_publish": "21/11/2018, 16:31:42", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s no big problem in the Malayalam industry.
