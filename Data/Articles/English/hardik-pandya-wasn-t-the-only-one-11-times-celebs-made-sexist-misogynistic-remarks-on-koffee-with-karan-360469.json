{"text": "How much do you know about the celebrity you love the most? Reel-life isn\u2019t always the same as the real-life, right? What better than the Hardik Pandya episode that came into the scanner recently!\nNo matter if you love them or hate them, or love to hate them, celebs can be fake, shallow, and insincere sometimes, basically human.\nScreengrab\nHardik Pandya might not have completed his studies, but his talent brought him to the forefront in the world of cricket. Hailed as the all-rounder, when Hardik Pandya was all set to appear on the show, the audiences were excited. For the first time, they would get to see the real side of the celebrity they loved. But somehow, things didn\u2019t turn around the way people would have expected. They were taken aback because not one but so many misogynistic and sexist remarks were made on the show.\n#hardikpandya on #KoffeeWithKaran is the reason why Parents should educate their children, teach them manners and bring them up as better human beings. \u2014 Tommy!! (@tommy_bytes) January 6, 2019\nDon't Miss 259 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\nThe consequences \u2013 they were both suspended for an indefinite period; they have to explain themselves in seven days; Hardik lost his Gymkhana honorary membership; and most probably, from now on, no celebrity would be allowed to be a part of such non-cricket chat show.\nJust one show, changed everything for both of them. Who would have expected this will lead to such serious repercussions! After all, this isn\u2019t the first time that such things were said on the show.\nTwitter\nIt\u2019s the sixth season that is airing currently, and Koffee With Karan has always been a source of rich gossip. A lot of celebrities in order to win the koffee hamper have gone brutally honest and crass. Like Aishwarya was called plastic by Emraan Hashmi, and that spoiled everything between them.\nThings turned so sour, that even now they don\u2019t talk to each other. In a recent interview, when Aishwarya was asked what\u2019s the worst comment that she has ever heard for herself, she said the one in which she was called plastic. This hatched won\u2019t perhaps be buried ever!\nYouTube\nThe hot couch of many controversies has had too many cringe-worthy moments over the years. But like they say, times are changing, people are more open-minded now, audiences have transformed, great scripts are being welcomed, the conversation about LGBTQ+ has been normalised. We moving towards a better society and, now crass is no longer acceptable. That being said, here are some of the sexist things said in the past over Koffee, on the same show, that earlier didn\u2019t become the eye of the storm. Perhaps, back then, people thought it was cool.\n#1 Ranveer Singh asked Anushka Sharma if she wants to get her \u201cass pinched\u201d while Karan Johar laughed uncontrollably.\nAnushka was clearly uncomfortable. Her expressions say it all. Sad, that this made to the final cut. Even more sad, that Karan Johar laughed uncontrollably thereafter.\n\"You want your ass pinched? I'm right here\" IS THIS YOUR HERO? Also look at how Kjo is laughing.

They are the ones who lure you, who are attractive, who seduce you\u201d.\nrediff.com\n#3 Ranveer\u2019s best pick-up line is the worst one, and you shouldn\u2019t ever use.\n\u201cIs that your phone in the back pocket, because that a** is calling me\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s Ranveer\u2019s best pick up line, and when he had revealed this, we all laughed at it apparently.\nTwitter\n#4 \u201cRate these actresses according to their sex appeal\u201d \u2013 this is perhaps the most asked question on the show.\n#5 Kareena Kapoor said that best profession for Sonakshi Sinha is being \u201ca housewife\u201d.\nHow uplifting that is. A woman trying to empower the other woman! Kareena thinks Sonakshi can\u2019t do anything but be a housewife.\nHotstar\n#6 Nargis Fakhri laughed off her \u201cbutt cheek\u201d remark like it was so cool!\nWhile talking about her name, the last name in particular which has often been mistaken for something else, she revealed that her first name too in Spanish sounds like Nalgas, which means butt cheeks. Didn\u2019t we all laugh at this too?\nYouTube\n#6 Karan Johar thinks Mallika can never play a girl-next-door role because according to him she is always saucy and sexy.\n\u201cCan you be a girl next door, Mallika? Can you really?? Even in Pyaar Ke Side Effects, there was kind of saucy, sexy vibe that ran through the film\u201d, he said.\nTwitter\n#8 Sanjay Dutt almost slut-shamed Kangana Ranaut.\n\u201cWhat would you do if you woke up one morning as Kangana,\u201d asked KJo, to which Sanjay Dutt replied, \u201cwear a Salwar-Kameez\u201d.\nHotstar\n#9 When Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone didn\u2019t want to talk about their former relationships, he tagged them as \u201cMother Priyanka\u201d and \u201cMother Deepika\u201d.\njfwonline.com\n#10 Emraan Hashmi flaunted his misogynist views.\n\u201cHas your wife just accepted the situation that you are a part of a lot of erotic films?\u201d, asked KJo, to which, he replied, \u201cWe have a deal. I take her shopping and she swipes the card close to seven-digit number.\u201d\nYouTube\n#11 Twinkle Khanna said Akshay Kumar has a few more inches than the Khans.\nWhen asked what is one thing that Akshay has and other Khans don\u2019t, Twinkle Khanna said, \u201cfew extra inches\u201d. We all laughed at this back then, remember?\nTwitter\nEveryone has been questioned in the recent Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul episode, but Karan Johar. He has laughed at the sexist comments made on the show so often. Isn\u2019t he answerable too?
