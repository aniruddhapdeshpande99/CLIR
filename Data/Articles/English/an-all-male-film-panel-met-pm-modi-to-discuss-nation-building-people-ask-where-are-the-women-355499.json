Women aren't part of nations, or the entertainment industry. (Or maybe even some buildings.) Patriarchy upholds everything \ud83e\udd37 https://t.co/qt4wDEAvFh \u2014 Vijayeta (@SacredInsanity) October 26, 2018\nSerious? Not a single woman in the delegation? https://t.co/YY3uBSZSSx \u2014 Nigel Britto (@NigelBritto) October 26, 2018\nHey Hon. PM, where are the brave women from #Bollywood who spoke up? Need to build the nation? Involve women! #MeTooIndia https://t.co/Ws3cWo0PSW \u2014 Hanisha Lalwani (@HanishaLalwani) October 26, 2018\nWhat?! No women in this gathering? Entertainment industry has women as an intrinsic part of it. How do they dream of nation building without involving women in the process? Disappointing. https://t.co/bXRQjNm9ET \u2014 N (@_morphiine_) October 26, 2018\nSo many women, wow. We're truly moving towards a equal society. We totally don't need feminism. Pfft. https://t.co/XJCVA1GNRg \u2014 Sulagna Chatterjee (@BeingChatterjee) October 26, 2018\nAnd ya'll didn't think it was important to have some women be a part of this? https://t.co/fMkfMAjxcQ \u2014 Junisha Dama (@bandeatqueen) October 26, 2018\nNO woman in the delegation!! These producers possibly think they can make the film and build the nation without women\u2019s participation. https://t.co/jbJJWG1aHP \u2014 Kanchan Srivastava (@Ms_Aflatoon) October 26, 2018\nWomen may hold up half the sky, but they can't touch the proverbial glass ceiling. https://t.co/k5pmwo3hhE \u2014 Kiran Manral (@KiranManral) October 26, 2018\nThe Indian entertainment industry has only men.
