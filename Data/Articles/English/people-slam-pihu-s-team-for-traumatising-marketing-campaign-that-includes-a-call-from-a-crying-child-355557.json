{"text": "Imagine you are sitting at home and you receive a frantic call from a crying 2-year old baby, who is asking for help?\nWell, even worst of your nightmares would be better than this scenario, right? However, this has turned into a reality when a film's marketing team decided to promote the film, converting this nightmare into a strategy.\nJust a few days ago, the trailer of Pihu was unveiled and it received a great response. The trailer sent chills down people's spine and people actually started looking forward to the film. The trailer had over 4.5 million views on YouTube.\nBut now, the film is being talked about on the internet and not for the right reasons.\nScreengrab\nTagging the concept of marketing that the film's team has been using as 'ill-conceived', people are ranting against their viral marketing campaign. Things went off the track when people starting receiving frantic phone calls from a crying child, asking for help.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nWhen people started calling back on the number to help the distressed kid, they got a message with the trailer link to help the child.\nScreengrab\nPeople are labeling this idea as horrible and insensitive.\nScreengrab\nJournalist Sudhir Srinivasan wrote on Twitter that he had received \u201ca call from an anonymous number. A baby wailed about her mother and dad, and hung up. Disturbed, I tried calling back in vain. Got a message with a link to help the child. A link, as it turns out, of #Pihu\u2019s trailer. A horrible idea, a disgusting invasion of privacy.\u201d\nAnother Twitter user said, \u201cMovie marketing has reached absurd levels.\"\nHere are some reactions that prove how this is a classic case of marketing gone wrong.\nCreepy. #Pihu\nComing to the marketing strategy, what a shit this\u2019s!

Especially when the phone call is of a baby crying for her parents. Movie marketing has reached absurd levels. \u2014 Shreemi Verma (@shreemiverma) October 26, 2018\nDid I just get a call from a hysterical child called Pihu asking for help ????

I am so traumatised \u2014 Chuman Das (@chumandas) October 26, 2018\nI just got a call from a child named Pihu who wanted desperate help. No. was 7024720657.
