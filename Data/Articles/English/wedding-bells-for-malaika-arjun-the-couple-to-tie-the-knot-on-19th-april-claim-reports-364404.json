{"text": "Lovebirds Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor have never gone on record to admit what they genuinely feel about each other but their actions have always spoken louder than words. The rumors of their wedding have been doing the rounds since a long time now but looks like there is indeed some truth to it.\nFresh reports claim that both Arjun and Malaika have locked in April 19 for their Church wedding. A report on a website claims that Malaika is all set to walk down the aisle on April 19. Only close friends and family members will be invited for the wedding and it definitely includes Malaika's close buddies Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karisma Kapoor.\nArjun's close buddy from the industry-Ranveer Singh and his wife Deepika Padukone are also expected at the wedding. Just a few days ago, when Anupama Chopra had asked Malaika about the wedding, she had said,\nDon't Miss 346 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\n\"This is all media made. Media is responsible for it.\"\nBut she did confess that she is in a romantic relationship with Arjun Kapoor. She said,\n\"I guess everyone wants to move on and find love and companionship with people they can relate to. And if you do, I think you are just lucky. If you can do that, I think you are lucky to find that second chance at being happy.\"\nJust to jog your memory a little, it was only recently that both Malaika and Arjun have been okay and open to the media spotlight.", "title": "Wedding Bells For Malaika-Arjun!
