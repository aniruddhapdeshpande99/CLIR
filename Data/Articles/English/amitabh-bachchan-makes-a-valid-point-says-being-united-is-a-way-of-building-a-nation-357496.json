We should be united to give fearless life for our future generation.\nAFP\n\"Today, people who have a destructive mindset are knocking our doors, but we can't fight them with similar mentalities. We can tackle it with oneness and it is the need of the hour. They don't fear with our weapons or with our strength but they will feel fearful when we will stand together against them. They want us to get divided in terms of our religion, language, state and tradition so, we should keep that in mind that till the time we will be divided, they will try to harm us.\"\nDon't Miss 3.6 K SHARES 862 SHARES 346 SHARES\nBig B said a united nation is a way of building a nation.\n\"Being united is not a social option but it's a way of building a nation.

We have to create an environment for our future generations where destructive minds would not be able harm us.\"\nTouching upon the evils of terrorism, Big B said: \"Terrorism is not just about holding the power to kill us but it is designed to destroy the integrity of our oneness.

We have drafted lots of faith and beliefs but human kind is one and humanity is one. Our oneness, unity and singularity is not limited to fighting with terror and anti-social ideologies. Our singularity is too vast to be shaken by limited horizons. Our solidarity is too strong to be broken by cowards.\n\"We must define ourselves not by what we are against but by what we are for and what we can be for if we are there for each other,\" Big B added.\nRecounting the aftermath of the horrific night when terror struck Mumbai, Akthar said: \"I clearly remember that evening just after few days of that horrific and barbarian terrorist attacks, people of Mumbai had gathered here in front of Gateway of India. At that time, we were furious, outraged and angry but at the same time, we were together and united.\nBCCL\n\"This is what Mumbai is. We are known as a commercial capital of India and I suppose commercial is not supposed to have heart, but whenever such kind of calamity has hit the city -- whether it's a terrorist attack, flood or any other calamity, Mumbai and Mumbaikars have shown that this city has had its heart at the right place.\"\nAkhtar also recited his poem \"Mumbai ko Salaam\" to pay tribute to people who have lost their lives in the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack.\nAlso present at the event were Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and singer Javed Ali among others.\nInputs from IANS", "title": "Amitabh Bachchan Makes A Valid Point, Says Being United Is A Way Of Building A Nation", "date_publish": "27/11/2018, 18:30:26", "description": "Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan says a nation that isnt united, shouldnt be called a nation.
