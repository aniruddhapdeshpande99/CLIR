Luckily, I was in Los Angeles at the same time. They wanted my character to return because it did well for them.\"\nKaur is excited for the opportunity and she said that she's looking forward to playing Tasneem again.\nTwitter\n\u201cThe opportunity to play it again and to jump into that universe is exciting. It is for the first time that I am repeating what I played onscreen,\u201d she said.\nShe recalled it was tough adjusting to a different type of role and a different working environment in Hollywood. \u201cIt was a little challenging when I got there as it was first time I was working abroad so the system was new to me.

She has moved up in authority and is a figure of great importance. There will be pivotal decisions taken by her. I don\u2019t know the complete arc of the character so I am not aware how she becomes in the end. I just have the script of the first few episodes in my hand\"\nIn such a scenario, she truly believes it is essential to have faith in the makers as they know the overview better. She said what she has learnt working on the series is the level of planning and the time the makers invest in pre-production.\n\u201cThere is proper clarity on the sets, everything works as per the clock. There is no room for error. I learnt to be spontaneous and not be worried about how it will pan out. I went with the flow and had trust.\u201d\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "Nimrat Kaur Is Excited For Her Comeback In The Eighth Installment Of American Series Homeland!", "date_publish": "03/02/2019, 15:31:25", "description": "Nimrat Kaur on her return to Homeland: Had no idea I will be brought back Nimrat, who played Tasneem Qureshi, an ISI officer in the fourth season of the award-winning show Homeland, will return for the eighth installment. \u201cWhen I did season four, I had no idea I will be brought back.
