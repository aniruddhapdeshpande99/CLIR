He made his debut with Shoojit Sircar's Vicky Donor in 2012 and went on to do some memorable and hit films like Dum Laga Ke Haisha and Shubh Mangal Savdhan.\nThis year, he tried a new genre and his first thriller Andhadhun, directed by Sriram Raghavan, is the best-reviewed film of the year. And now, Khurrana has managed to strike gold with another hit film, Badhaai Ho, which is garnering a positive response.\nTalking to PTI, Ayushmann said, \"I approach all my films as my first. If you carry that innocence, it reflects in the camera. I know I have become a star but I don't want to believe it. I want to be that simple, no fuss guy who approaches a film as if it is my first movie.\"\nDon't Miss 862 SHARES 322 SHARES 197 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\nFor 34-year old Ayushmann, choosing films is entirely dependent on his intuition. He says,\n\"My acting career has been quite a ride. After Vicky Donor, I gave two-three unsuccessful films and that was a great learning curve. But Dum Laga Ke Haisha onwards it was cool. I learned so much from all my films, successful or unsuccessful. You start believing in your intuition, your gut feeling. It ultimately depends on the choices you're taking. Everyone is talented today. Your career graph depends on the choice of scripts, nothing else.\"\nFor Ayushmann, the best of being grounded is to surround oneself with people who keep things real. He adds,\n\"To maintain the innocence depends on the kind of people you hang out with. I have made friends from the industry but I still hang out with my Chandigarh friends. Your family can keep you grounded, make you keep things real.\"\nHe adds how as an actor, he is always on a hunt to look out for different subjects. He adds,\n\"My first aspiration is to be consistent. Atul Kasbekar (producer) once said I'm like Rahul Dravid of Bollywood, I pick up the right deliveries and hit the sweet spot, but otherwise, I am chill and never try too hard. That's a great analogy, I love it. The running thread of my career has been different scripts. There isn't any reference point for any of the films -- Vicky Donor, Andhadhun or Badhaai Ho -- so people find it exciting because they haven't seen anything like this. I'm quite proud of it.\"\nOn Thursday, his film Bahdaai Ho released that has him as the son of an elderly couple who finds out they would be turning parents for the third time. Talking about the project, he adds,\n\"It wasn't just that one quirky line 'what to expect when your mother is expecting' but the whole script won me over. Everyone is a hero in the film from Gajraj Rao, Neena Gupta to everyone. It's such a balanced film which focuses on everyone.\"\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "After Back To Back Hits, Ayushmann Khurrana Explains How Both Hit And Flop Films Have Taught Him A Lot!", "date_publish": "19/10/2018, 16:26:30", "description": "Ayushmann Khurrana knows that he has become a star, but he can\u2019t believe it Ayushmann Khurrana credits his intuition for delivering a series of successful films such as Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho.
