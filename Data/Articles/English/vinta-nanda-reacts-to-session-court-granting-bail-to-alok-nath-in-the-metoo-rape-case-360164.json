One of them that took everyone by surprise was writer-producer Vinta Nanda, who has accused Alok Nath of rape, about 20 years ago. Taking her fight forward, she even filed a case seeking justice.\nHowever, the session\u2019s court granted bail to the Bollywood actor last week saying that rape against him was lodged on the basis of a \"defamatory\" and \"false\" report of complainant Vinta Nanda, as per a report in PTI.\nGranting relief to Nath on a surety bond of Rs 5 lakh, Additional Sessions Court Judge S S Oza said the rape complaint filed by the screenwriter is a \"personal vendetta\". The judge noted that the allegation raised by the complainant might have been inspired by her \"unrequited and un-reciprocated love\" for Alok Nath.\nTOI\nReacting to this, Vinta Nanda says she respects the court's order and adds that the entire industry knows the truth.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\u201cEveryone who knows me and who knows Alok Nath personally also knows the truth and there is nothing in the world that will change those facts.
