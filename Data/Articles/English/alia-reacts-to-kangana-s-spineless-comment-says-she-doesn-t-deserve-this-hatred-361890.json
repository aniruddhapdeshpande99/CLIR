{"text": "Kangana Ranaut might be basking in the success of her latest film Manikarnika but she is in no mood to be unforgiving with Bollywood for not extending any support to her film. Ever since the film has released, it has courted many controversies but Kangana has been on a mission to 'expose' each and every Bollywood celebrity who has ever wronged her.\nIn one of her promotional interviews for Manikarnika, she targeted Alia Bhatt and accused her of being a puppet, controlled by Karan Johar. She had said,\n\u201cI reached out to Alia and asked her what makes her think Manikarnika is my personal controversy, it\u2019s a film whole nation is talking about and wondering why Bollywood is keeping quiet on such a relevant work...I suggested that she grows some spine and supports an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism...if she doesn\u2019t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo's (Karan Johar) puppet then I don\u2019t consider her successful...I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value...,\u201d\nReacting to Kangana's strong comments against her, she said,\n\"I would like to react to her personally if she has any complaints. I don\u2019t want to talk about it in the media. As I have said before, I really admire her as an actor and the choices that she makes. She\u2019s a very outspoken person and I admire her for that as well. If I have upset her unintentionally, then I don\u2019t know. Basically, it wasn\u2019t my intention. I didn\u2019t do anything to get a reaction like this.\"\nDon't Miss 126 SHARES 336 SHARES 247 SHARES 699 SHARES\nEven earlier, Alia had a graceful reaction to Kangana's snide remarks. She had said,\n\u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t dislike me and I don\u2019t think she dislikes me. I don\u2019t think I have done anything intentionally to upset her. If I have, I will apologise to her on a personal level.\"\nOn the work front, Alia Bhatt is currently in Germany with her team of Gully Boy, attending the Berlin Film Festival and the premiere of her film.", "title": "Alia Reacts To Kangana's 'Spineless' Comment, Says She Doesn't Deserve This Hatred", "date_publish": "10/02/2019, 14:57:32", "description": "Kangana Ranaut might be basking in the success of her latest film Manikarnika but she is in no mood to be unforgiving with Bollywood for not extending any support to her film.
