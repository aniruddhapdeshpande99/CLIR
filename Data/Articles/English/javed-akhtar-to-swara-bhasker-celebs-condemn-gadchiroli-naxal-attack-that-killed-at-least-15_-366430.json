Dastardly, inhuman & reflects the utterly degenerate mindset of the so-called \u2018revolutionaries\u2019. Ultra left & anarchist violence weakens democracy, hurts the poor. The state must crack down on perpetrators & ensure justice \u2014 Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) May 1, 2019\nMy tributes to the martyrs & jawans who lost their lives in terrible #NaxalAttack on our security personnel in #Gadchiroli, #Maharashtra.

In solidarity with the families of those that lost their loved ones. Prayers, love, strength. These words have started to seem hollow for they are said too often. Salute to our commandoes. #Gadchiroli \u2014 Mithali Raj (@M_Raj03) May 1, 2019\nStrongly condemn the despicable attack on our security personnel in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra. I salute all the brave personnel. Their sacrifices will never be forgotten. My thoughts & solidarity are with the bereaved families. The perpetrators of such violence will not be spared. \u2014 Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 1, 2019\nThis is a ghastly attack - burning a dozen vehicles to create the diversion to boobytrap security forces. Such terror tactics must be condemned by every Indian.\nTerrorism has no ideology or flag - red, green, saffron or black. Nothing justifies any kind of terrorism!#IndiaFirst https://t.co/OZUpcJHGXe \u2014 Rakesh Sharma (@rakeshfilm) May 1, 2019\nThe dastardly attack on our security personnel in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra is shameful & sad. I hope the urban naxals, Congress, tukde tukde gang , Lutyens media will not ask for proofs of this massacre of our soldiers.
