{"text": "An article on Priyanka Chopra that labelled her as a scam artist went viral on the internet and for all the wrong reasons. The publication and the author started receiving a lot of flak for their regressive and sexist comments. In less than twenty-four hours, they pulled down the article and apologized for their write up.\nPeople Magazine\nExtending the apology, they had written: \"An earlier story about Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas did not meet our standards. We've removed it and apologize.\"\nThe author of the article received a lot of backlash for her story.\nYo, Mariah Smith had the absolute gall to write about Priyanka being a scammer with a Spon-Con wedding when she herself got a whole-ass birthday party paid for by brands.\ud83d\ude02https://t.co/Ki9zkKtcul \u2014 Bennett D.

You should know better and you know you\u2019re better than that. What you wrote is totally beyond! I feel the BITTERNESS in each word you put in it! You\u2019re unbelievable! \u2014 Ushi Sato (@UshiSato) December 5, 2018\nThe backlash against The Cut and Mariah Smith\u2019s trash garbage article is well deserved. She absolutely should have known better. Its baffles me that she even thought it would be okay to write something so offensive & degrading.
