In Gully Boy, I had to be this quiet boy who deals with a lot of inner emotions. In fact after shooting for a scene, I used to not even see the monitor, we shot the entire film and I didn\u2019t even see one scene of mine, I had no clue about it, after the shooting Zoya went to New York for 6 months for the edit of the film, and just yesterday she showed me the teaser of the film and I was like F***K. It is that crazy, I swear if there would be an actor other than me in this teaser I would be burnt to crisp, I would be damn jealous of that actor. It\u2019s Mumbai, its Hip hop, It\u2019s ME\u201d.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the teaser then you are definitely missing out. The teaser also features Alia Bhatt and Kalki Koechlin, both the actresses look outstanding and super promising.", "title": "Deepika Is The Biggest Fan Of Ranveer, Calls Him 'Unstoppable' After Watching Gully Boy Teaser", "date_publish": "04/01/2019, 17:23:48", "description": "Ranveer Singh is a star now.
