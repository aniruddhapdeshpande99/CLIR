{"text": "From books to movies, we have seen everything including dramatic performances getting censored in the nation. In the age of over-the-top media service platforms like Netflix, how can you expect censorship to not apply to the internet?\nFor some, art can be intimidating too. That\u2019s perhaps the reason why an episode of Patriotic Act with Hasan Minhaj, is pulled from streaming in Saudi Arabia after its government complained that it showed the kingdom in a negative light.\nTwitter\nThe episode apparently focused on journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing inside Turkey\u2019s Saudi consulate. It is said that during the act, host Hasan Minhaj referred to Silicon Valley as \u201cswimming in Saudi cash\u201d.
