I think today is the time for content and only content, there are lots of stars who do content-driven films, slowly there is a change happening. Yes, it\u2019s not a complete change but it\u2019s okay, there are films that are packaged around the stars but it\u2019s fine, they have their different target audience. Today the concept of hero and heroine has changed. For instance, I played a protagonist in Hunterrr who was not all heroic, he was the biggest loser, I think the audience should stop watching the film like ye hero ya heroine hai.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not easy to survive in Bollywood without having a godfather we quizzed Gulshan how did he manage to make his mark, he said, \u201cIf you want to survive here, you should have tremendous self-belief, you have to know who you are, if you don\u2019t, you have to figure out, whatever is your ambition you have to be true to that and accept the reality first, it\u2019s a cutthroat place, it\u2019s a ruthless business, art ek jagah hai , business ek jagah hai. They don\u2019t seem to travel parallel, so you have to have the clarity and vision of what you want to be.\u201d\nTwitter\nHe further added, \u201cI have never been drawn myself towards that business, I don\u2019t have a natural inclination focusing on business having that kind of fame and stardom, yes, I romanticized and fanaticized in my head sometimes a little too , much , some people achieve and some don\u2019t, you can\u2019t manufacture stardom, maybe you can, few months you can behave like a star with your whole PR mechanism, but stardom tabhi hi milta hai jab log aapko pyaar dete hai, they will give you that love only then you can become a true star. But that is something I fantasize, if I can leave my legacy behind, I want to be remembered as the best and versatile actor of my time and in this process, If i get stardom then it's welcome.\u201d\nWhen we asked about his biggest fear, he said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a volatile business, firstly to say that you are a working actor is such a big thing, it\u2019s nearly impossible because in India everyone wants to become a cricketer or actor, the biggest fear is I just want to be relevant to the time, I try my best to sort of be there, I have seen many veteran actors who were the biggest stars at one point, have lost their relevancy and I just don\u2019t want to get into that space, I know that\u2019s a harsh reality for all of us, some people have managed the transition and have really long careers. I want to work till I feel I should work and want to be in a place where i can say I am done, I don\u2019t want it to be ki, koi muje le nahi raha, mai chodunga tab jab mai decide karunga, so I want to be able to do that and I am not sure if I can so I fear that.\u201d\nWe hope that day doesn\u2019t come and he continues to entertain us with his outstanding work.", "title": "'Hunterrr' Star Gulshan Devaiah's Biggest Fear Is Not Getting Work In Movies & Losing Relevance", "date_publish": "20/03/2019, 12:16:09", "description": "Despite being so talented and proving his mettle in every film Gulshan has a fear of not getting work in Bollywood as it is the most unpredictable place, you never know what\u2019s going to happen next.
