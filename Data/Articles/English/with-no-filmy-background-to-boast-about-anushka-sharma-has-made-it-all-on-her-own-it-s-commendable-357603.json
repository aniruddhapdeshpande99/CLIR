Films, failures, achievements, future plans and everything in between.\nTwitter\n#Being Nervous After The Completion of Film Is Mindless Thinking\nTo begin with, she was asked if she is nervous about the release of her film Zero, she said, \u201c I am not nervous, I feel nervous when I generally begin my work on it, like before shooting for Zero I was extremely nervous on whether I can pull of my character or not. But now I am not because I have done it with the best of my ability, and so I don\u2019t want to do mindless thinking.\"\nDon't Miss 3.5 K SHARES 518 SHARES 235 SHARES\n#Don\u2019t Take Baggage Of Failure On Another Film\nAnushka was informed how SRK admitted he did a mistake choosing Jab Harry Met Sejal and does she feel the same and how careful was she on choosing another film after the failure, to which she said, \"I don\u2019t take baggage of another film and go forward; it\u2019s a different team and story I am working with, so I genuinely don\u2019t feel that way. When you take baggage of success or failure on to the next film it doesn\u2019t work. When you take baggage of a successful film on another film you become complacent and when you take baggage of a bad film on your another film you become fearful and bring a lot of bad energy to your work and even for others on set.\u201d\nInstagram\n#Take Challenging Roles Because That Keeps Me Going\nAnushka speaks on why she loves doing challenging roles, \u201cI take challenging films because otherwise I get bored, if I am not doing something which excites me then I get really bored, I want to reinvent myself with every film and I feel it\u2019s important for me. And this year has been high on performances for me, with Pari, Sui Dhaaga and Zero. It\u2019s good take up something which is not easy for you and then, when you pull it off it\u2019s a sense of accomplishment.\u201d\nInstagram\n#Will Not Do Just A Glamours Role & Have Nothing To Do In It\nAnushka said she will never pick a glamours role and do nothing in it, \u201c Of course I will do glamours role, but I should be happy with the role too, I should know na ki mai kuch kar rahi hu, I don\u2019t want to do a role in which I don\u2019t have anything to contribute to, I have not done that ever. Right from my first film, I have done a role where it required me to perform, and that\u2019s very important for me, I can\u2019t just do a role to look glamours. I am glamorous anyway.\u201d\n#Anuhska Talks About The Most Challenging Roles In Her Career\n\"Every role challenges you in a different way, for example Sui Dhaaga, I could not rely on my instincts and react, I had to think so much about how that character must be feeling and then react on it. You have to really change your thought process for it. Mamta\u2019s character was totally opposite of me, similarly with Pari, to become so messed up in your head, and you are not even human ,you are half demonic, so where do I get the reference from? Even Sultan had it's own set of challenges. \"\n#Achieved It On My Own Had No Film Background\nThe actress is super proud of her achievements , \u201cI am very happy with the way things are moving forward. You have to understand that I was very young when I started my own production house, I want to really credit myself for having done what I dreamt off and achieved it on my own. I don\u2019t come from a filmy background, so I have done it all on my own with my brother and it\u2019s a big thing. I take a lot of pride in what I am doing.\u201d\n#Not An Insecure Actor\n\"I am not insecure as an actor. Whenever I suggest something it\u2019s not out of greed that my character or role will become nice or strong, I think on the whole because I am a producer too, and that is why maybe I have worked with best of directors.\"\nInstagram\n#Was Working Even Two Days Before My Wedding\n\"When I am acting in a film which I am producing, it automatically takes double my time. Also I am an entrepreneur, I have my clothing line and I genuinely look into it. I had a very chaotic last year, in fact I was working before last 2 days of my marriage and after that I took a week off for my wedding, I came aback and started shooting for Sui Dhaaga. So, it\u2019s been mentally exhausting for me. Before I start anything new I want to get prepared for it. I don't want to burn out.\"\nInstagram\nMs Sharma is clearly an inspiration for all.", "title": "Anushka Sharma Is Proud Of Her Achievements As She Is An Outsider & Had No Filmy Background", "date_publish": "29/11/2018, 18:09:44", "description": "There are lots of outsiders who have made it big in Bollywood and proved you don\u2019t need a filmy family to become successful in the film industry and Anushka Sharma is one of them.
