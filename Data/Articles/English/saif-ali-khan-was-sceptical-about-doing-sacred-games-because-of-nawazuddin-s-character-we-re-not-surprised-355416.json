From social media to dining table discussions, India\u2019s Netflix original show that enthralled the audiences was the talk of the town for several weeks. So much so, that those who hadn\u2019t watched the show felt left out and had to eventually give in to the peer pressure.\ndailypioneer.com\nBut can you tell as to who\u2019s your favourite character on the show? Ganesh Gaitonde played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui sure, is the heart and the soul of the show. But you wouldn\u2019t disagree that the supporting characters including that of Bunty or Kukko gave exceptional performances too.\nnypdecider.files.wordpress.com\nAnd that is one thing that Saif Ali Khan, who plays the role of Sartaj Singh on the show, had also realised when he read the script of the show.\nDon't Miss 862 SHARES 183 SHARES 406 SHARES\n\u201cI felt like he (Sartaj Singh) is getting slapped by everybody. What\u2019s happening? Some second rate thug Bunty is jhaaping him. I got irritated. But it takes time. And if you see the show and I saw it much later... I asked him, \u2018Are you sure you want me to do this role because this other guy has such a fun colour?\u2019 and I was told that those things are true but we have seen that before.\nHe says he was sceptical about doing this role.\n\u201cSo I said to myself that \u2018just be confident\u2019. Sartaj is a fascinating character. He\u2019s holding the show forward. Technically, the show is not moving forward without him. He is the soul and grounds it. And then, you need something to believe in otherwise everyone can be immoral.\u201d\nPTI\nSaif Ali Khan agrees that Sartaj Singh has been a very different role for him, especially in terms of responsibility.\n\u201cThe idea was not to get tensed that the other guy is seeming to get all the attention but just more attention. And on a deeper level, and enough journalists have said it to me to get my justification -- that it is Sartaj\u2019s show.\nmafab.hu\n\u201cHe could have easily been this gun-toting cop but he\u2019s not. He\u2019s screwed on every level in his personal life. He\u2019s trying to commit suicide, maybe by drinking the drain cleaner. Everyone is hitting and punching him, he\u2019s so down. Perhaps that\u2019s what made us feel that he\u2019s different. I think the fact that I did it and did it quite willing to get slapped made a difference.\u201d\nAlso Read: Sacred Games To Baazar, Saif Ali Khan Feels He Is Better Than Ever As An Actor & We Completely Agree\nWith inputs from IANS", "title": "Saif Ali Khan Was Sceptical About Doing Sacred Games Because Of Nawazuddin's Character & We're Not Surprised", "date_publish": "25/10/2018, 12:44:18", "description": "Saif Ali Khan, who plays the role of Sartaj Singh on the show, said that he was doubtful about playing Sartaj Singh in Netflix India's original show Sacred Games. \u201cI felt like he (Sartaj Singh) is getting slapped by everybody.
