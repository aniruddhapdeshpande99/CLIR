It's true!\nTwitter\nThe man who beats up 200 people at a time and makes it look believable, enters the room for an interview with us and sees a full plate of samosas lying on the table and immediately says, \u2018yaar iske hata do mere aankhon ke saamne se\u2019. Obviously soon he was asked how does he control his cravings, to which he said, \u201cI smell the food and make myself feel full, sukoon mil jaata hai muje, kaam dhanda hai hamara fit rehna, everybody nowadays is health conscious and we need to look a certain way, the heroes are meant to look a certain way, have six packs, this and that, aaj ka daur hi aisa hai, We have to struggle a lot\u201d.\nTalking about how he fulfills his cravings Tiger added, \u201c I love to eat anything and everything that tastes good, because what I eat doesn\u2019t tastes good, so I love cheating on Sundays, I mean cheat meals and I eat everything from chocolates to fried food\".\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 357 SHARES 207 SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\nHe then went on to reveal how much he enjoyed becoming the Student Of the Year, he said, \u201cIt was a breeze. It\u2019s not a Baaghi or Hrithik vs Tiger film, isme thodha aaram mila muje, I\u2019m playing somebody who is closer to my age, I never got a chance to go college so I lived that moment, so it was quite fun. Isme toh padhai hai hi nahi, isme toh bada mazedaar experience raha. It\u2019s just a fun film and it\u2019s not at all preachy. I promise audience will go back with a smile on their face.\u201d\nTwitter\nTalking about Baaghi 2 becoming his game changer, Tiger said, \u201cWith Baaghi 2, I didn\u2019t expect what it did. I was like is this really happening and then it made Rs 165 crores, it couldn\u2019t have been just because of the last 15 minutes of action that I did. There must have been the stories and characters that caught on, so it\u2019s very important to get the combination of emotion along with the action, there has to be a motto of a hero, what he is fighting for and why is he fighting. I then realised that the script is the most important thing to make a hit film, the action is just the decoration part of it.\u201d\nBut still he isn\u2019t called a versatile actor and looks like Tiger isn\u2019t affected by it at all and in fact, is thankful to being typecasted as an action hero, he says,\n\u201cI am not versatile at all, I look at the bright side that I have an identity already, jab logo sochte hai action hero, then one of the names could be Tiger Shroff in your head, so that makes me feel good. In the world where there is so much competition and so many new actors being launched every second, how does one standout , how does one have an identity, it\u2019s so important, so just being typecasted and being termed gives me an identity in a way, so I am very happy.\u201d\nTiger even admitted that Baaghi 2 success bought him all the respect and attention, \u201c After Baaghi 2 the expectations have obviously gone up for myself, because I have seen how my life has changed suddenly after getting that number, people started looking at me in a different light, as a bankable star, giving lot of respect, achanak se sab log tameez se baat kar rahe ha, I was like kya ho raha hai. I felt really good, I walked on to the sets of Dharma for the first time during Student Of The Year 2 narration and there was so much respect and love for me, everyone was calling me sir, I was like don\u2019t call me sir, I am younger than you, achanak se izzat mila muje, It felt so nice that people are appreciating what I have done.\u201d\nTwitter\nLastly when asked how does he not let success go to his head, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not at all gone to my head because I have grown up seeing my father\u2019s journey, from where he came to where he reached and he saw his downfall and now again he is trying to come up. I have seen it all, and I have too much insecurity about myself to let that success go to my head, I still feel that I have a long journey to go and I need to prove so much.\u201d\nTiger is here to stay and has proved it time and again.", "title": "Tiger Shroff Feels People Started Taking Him Seriously After Baaghi 2 Success & He's Grateful", "date_publish": "01/05/2019, 18:02:40", "description": "Tiger Shroff the man is who is the fittest actor in B town, makes the girls drool over his six packs was seen cribbing over on not having samosa\u2019s.
