No matter what genre film he takes up, Arshad gives his best as he genuinely works hard which reflects on the screen.\nInstagram\nThe actor whose last multi starrer release Golmaal 4 was a huge hit is coming with a solo release Fraud Saiyaan where he plays a con man. Indiatimes had an exclusive chat with our all time favourite Arshad Wasi where he spoke about his success, sustainability in Bollywood and more.\nArshad is one of the few actors who can pull off a comedy film as well as a serious role with utmost ease. That surely makes him a jack of all trades. \u201c I don\u2019t think I am a saleable actor, period! I enjoy acting, that\u2019s really the truth, it really doesn\u2019t matter what genre I am doing. I am not comfortable with sex comedy, so I won\u2019t do it, but I enjoy all genre of acting. I would like to do a lot more serious films; I don\u2019t get scripts like that now. I believe you better give a valid reason for me to get out of my house to come and work, I do some movies out of respect and various other stupid reasons, I do them, well that\u2019s that.\u201d\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nTwitter\nTalking about his film choices going wrong sometimes and how he deals with it, Arshad said,\n\u201cI have no reasons to complain, you complain when things have gone bad? I cannot complain because before getting in the industry, I was really working hard for a living, and then I got into movies, and from then to now I have only started living better and better. So I have no reason to complain.\nInstagram\nA film doing well or not doing well is not the end of the life, it\u2019s just a part of your life, you move on, it\u2019s a phase. In a larger picture, my life has only improved, but I am not satisfied, I want more, and when I say more, I want better films, I want to do good work, I want to enjoy what I am doing. I love the fact when people come and tell me they loved my work or the film I have worked in. I genuinely love that, that\u2019s my desire. I don\u2019t have a desire to earn more money now.\u201d\nTwitter\nThe actor is glad that his acting ability hasn't been questioned till date , \u201cThankfully not even one critic has said that I have acted terribly in the film, so I am okay as I have done my job, but yes it feels bad when films don\u2019t work because you have put so much effort, gone out and did something you believed, but it just dies. At times you know some films you are doing will die when you start, it\u2019s very few that die and you are shocked how come this film did not do well? Like Guddu Rangeela, I thought it will work, it was a nice film, it was very hard for me to figure out what went wrong. But I am sure there must be a reason.\u201d\nTwitter\nArshad doesn't let his fab movies and flop films affect him. He calls it a phase,\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything of my achievements or failures, I think it\u2019s absolute nonsense, it\u2019s just a phase that comes and goes, I don\u2019t let my failures and success rule my life.\u201d\nInstagram\nWe quizzed him if it's easy for newbie actors who gets instant success to get carried away in the glitz and glamour. He agreed and said,\n\u201cOne of the major reasons why success goes into your head is not because of the actor, it\u2019s the parasites around them, who hang with them, those are the people that poison their mind by saying they are invincible, greatest and these words somewhere starts working on them. I don\u2019t travel with anybody, I go by myself, I have no baggage around me, I have no yes men around me, I have nobody who\u2019s standing behind me and saying, \u2018 Wahh sir\u2019, kya baat hai\u2019. When initially I had started, I had these people around me and started feeling maybe they are right, but one day I thought maybe they are completely wrong, and if they are completely wrong, they are damaging me, so this is not good, I could feel it, that it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nWell, the actor has definitely seen some highs and lows but takes each day as it comes.
