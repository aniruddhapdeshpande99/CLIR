HBO has a lot more in store for you.\nThere will definitely be Game of Thrones spin-offs. Yes, not one but there are five prequel series in the pipeline already, according to reports.

What is it about? \u201cFrom the horrifying secrets of Westeros\u2019s history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend, only one thing is for sure: It\u2019s not the story we think we know.\u201d\nthebritishberliner.files.wordpress.com\nThis bit of information has given rise to the excited Game of Thrones fans who have their own theories on what will the show be about. Take a look!\nDon't Miss 161 SHARES 842 SHARES\n#1 It could be about Essos!\nwallpaperup.com\nWondering what\u2019s Essos? You sure know about Westeros \u2013 the continent located in the far west of the known world of Game of Thrones. It\u2019s not the only continent in the world of Game of Thrones. There\u2019s Essos as well \u2013 located in the East of the known world. Essos is the home of the Free Cities and it served as the backdrop to many of the Game Of Thrones's Daenerys Targaryen-centric storylines. Fans suspect that one of the prequels could be about Essos.\nAlso, HBO\u2019s synopsis reads, \u201cTaking place thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones, the series chronicles the world's descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour.\u201d\n#2 Origin of White Walkers\nbleedingcool.com\nRemember the first ever episode of Game of Thrones from season one begins with white walkers. But how did they rise from the dead? Did the Children of The Forest had something to do with that? One of the prequels is suspected to be about this \u2013 the origin of White Walkers.\n#3 The Age Of Heroes\nYouTube\nMentioned in the synopsis of Game Of Thrones prequels, The Age Of Heroes could be the possible subject of one of the series. This one, according to theories, will focus on the formation of Stark house. This will focus on Brandon Stark AKA Brandon the Builder, the legendary founder of the house of Stark, who build the Wall and Winterfell with the help of the giants, as people say.\nPerhaps, this will also tell stories of how other houses were formed. There\u2019ll be lot of politics, we\u2019re sure.\nFun fact: Well, some theories also suggest that Bran Stark is actually Bran the builder. It\u2019s getting insane, right? He is also the Night King, some say.\n#4 Empire of Ash\nwatchersonthewall.com\nFor all those who like dragons, this one is for you all. If the theories are to be believed, this one will be set in Valyria, a ruined city in Essos, which was destroyed because of \u201csocial, economic, and political crises\u201d a century before Aegon's Landing by an event called the Doom of Valyria. This one will include the story of dragons and House Targaryen, a family of dragon lords during that time.\n#5 The King Beyond the Wall\nTwitter\nThis Game of Thrones prequel will be about the leader who manages to unite all the wildlings under his command to pose a threat to the seven kingdoms south of the wall. This one might show the Starks in the bad light, because it will be from the perspective of the King beyond the wall.\nAlso, if you\u2019re expecting Jon Snow (Kit Harington) or Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) to be a part of the show, you should know that George RR Martin has already revealed that the prequels won\u2019t have any of the characters from the current season. It will focus on their ancestors. So, there will not be an Iron Throne or King\u2019s landing. Well, that\u2019s a bummer, but we are sure it will surpass our expectation levels.\nGame of Thrones prequels are likely to be released in 2020.", "title": "Game Of Thrones Isn\u2019t Ending Post Season 8, There\u2019ll Be Prequels & These Theories Will Keep You Hooked!", "date_publish": "09/02/2019, 12:38:30", "description": "Game of Thrones prequels are in the works.
