In an interview with Indian Express, he revealed that he has warned daughter Suhana Khan of being cautious of boys who behave like his onscreen characters.\nYashraj Films\nHe added that if Suhana ever meets someone like lover boy Rahul, the quintessential loverboy that he has so often played in his films, he would rather have her \u2018kick him in the shins\u2019. He was quoted as saying,\nInstagram/Suhana\n\u201cWhat is the essence of romance? To make somebody feel it at a particular moment in time. Personally, I\u2019m not like that. If I stood with my arms open and sang a song in front of my wife, probably she\u2019d throw me out of the house. I told my daughter, that if a guy meets you and says, \u2018Rahul, naam toh suna hoga\u2019, he\u2019s a stalker. If a boy looks at you across a room at a party and says, \u2018Aur paas, aur paas\u2019, go kick him in the shins. But in the film, if I\u2019m able to activate an element of innocence and make it attractive, the role gets reinvented by itself.\"\nDon't Miss 343 SHARES 555 SHARES 263 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\nWell, that's not all.
