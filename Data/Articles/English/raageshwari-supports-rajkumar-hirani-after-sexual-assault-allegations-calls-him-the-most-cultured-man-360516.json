In the new year, it\u2019s like the beginning of a new chapter.\nIn shocking news, Bollywood\u2019s most sought after and most favourite director Rajkumar Hirani was accused of sexual harassment.

I\u2019m not speaking as an actress cementing bonds, hence I speak with utmost honesty and with zero agenda here. I speak as a family friend and most importantly, as a woman,\u201d she was quoted as saying by TOI.\nTwitter\nJaved Akhtar also sided Rajkumar Hirani and said that he is the most decent person.\nI had come to the film industry in 1965. After so many years if I am asked who are the most decent people you met in this industry over almost 5 decades, perhaps the first name that will come to my mind is RAJU HIRANI.
