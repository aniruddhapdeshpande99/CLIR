{"text": "11.45 am I am making insecticide by mixing sugar powder with boric acid when my nani calls, \u2018Biren Bhai is arriving from Surat today.\nSend the driver to fetch your uncle from the station.\u2019\n\u2018Nani, my driver is on leave today and I can\u2019t go either! There is a nasty ant infestation at home that I am trying to get rid of.\u2019 She replies, \u2018You should not kill ants, they are very lucky.\u2019\n\u2018Yes Nani,\u2019 I mutter, \u2018Ants are lucky, it\u2019s just people like me covered in bites who are unlucky.\u2019\nbccl\nMy protests are pushed aside, and as usual Nani manages to get me to do her bidding.\n3 pm Once Biren Bhai and his dabba of precious fafdas are safely ensconced in the car, he begins rattling away in great excitement. \u2018When are you coming to Gujarat? You have to come to see the Statue of Unity, not very expensive, only Rs 350.\u2019\nDon't Miss 9.8 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\nI reply, \u2018I thought it was 3,000 crore, no?\u2019\n\u2018Dikri, that is for the full and final statue, this I am telling you is ticket price for observation deck view.\u2019\nI reply, \u2018Have you heard about the controversy over the statue? There was an article in the Daily Mail filled with British outrage about the UK giving 1.17 billion pounds as aid to India and us spending around a third of that on erecting statues.\u2019\nMy uncle gets annoyed, \u2018Amtha, amtha sawal nai puch. British people are all salo chors! They took billions from us and tucked it nicely in their khisu, now what they are giving is interest on our capital only.\u2019\nFinally though, the four-and-a-half hours on Paschim Express take their toll and he nods off.\n5 pm Pulling out weeds in my garden, I look out at the tranquil Arabian Sea. If things go according to plan, soon enough I will be able to spot a 212m Shivaji statue rising from the waves.\nI recall reading a story about a philosophy professor who filled an empty jar with rocks, and then asked his students if the jar was full. When the students nodded, he dropped pebbles inside which rolled in between the rocks.\nThe professor then poured sand and filled up the remaining areas of the jar. Using it as an analogy for well-being, he said, \u2018This jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things \u2014 your family and your health. The pebbles are other things that matter like your job, your house. The sand is everything else, all the small stuff. If you put the sand into the jar first then there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks.\u2019\nBut I wonder if we as a nation are focusing more on building sand castles in our jars. The Global Hunger Index 2018 ranks India at a poor 103 out of 119 countries, with one out of every five children under the age of five suffering from acute under-nutrition.\nThe World Health Organisation reports that 14 of the world\u2019s most polluted cities are in our country, with Kanpur topping the list. Our focus though seems to be on renaming cities and building towering statues. But I suppose, if playing statue-statue is the name of the game then we may as well spend another few hundred crore to ensure that the world\u2019s tallest statues are made a tad more relevant by having the world\u2019s biggest anti-pollution masks sitting jauntily on their noses.\n8 pm Not only do I have ants running around my house looking for edible items but I also have relatives who are doing the same. My mother arrives with Nani and Biren Bhai, while my mother-in-law has invited all her five brothers.\nbccl\nWhile Mother is nagging me about how the hot snacks are apparently not hot enough, Biren Bhai has been discussing his new business venture with the mamas. On hearing snatches of their conversation, I am almost tempted to ask my uncle if the tallest statue in the world has inspired him to invest in a product called Dr Ayurveda Height Increaser. Vinay mama turns to my mother-in-law and reels off product details from Biren Bhai\u2019s phone: \u201cThis product increases height in humans. It has no side-effects and is approved by Medical Council of India.\u201d He then adds with a laugh, \u201cArre Biren Bhai, this is a foolish business idea! How can this work on adults? At our age the only direction we can grow in is sideways.\u2019\nOver the years, I have noticed that politics has affected our family on a deeply personal level. When Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, my in-laws dancing to the tune of Singh is King would bully my meeker Gujarati relatives, but after Modiji has taken over, the Gujjus are ready with snappy comebacks.\nA belligerent Biren Bhai retorts, \u2018What do you know about business? Let me tell you all great businessmen in India \u2014 Ambani, Adani, Kotak \u2014 are all Gujarati! You people may have muscle power but we have brain power. My bapuji always used to say, \u201cIn business, Sindhis sell and Punjabis buy, but the middle person who makes a profit is none other than a Gujarati.\u201d\u2019\nUnfortunately since Biren Bhai has not begun consuming the Height Increaser pills, he is still considerably tinier than Vinay mama. And before mamaji turns him from a spongy khaman into a deflated thepla, the man of the house quickly leads him away.\nI look at my nani and sigh, \u2018Don\u2019t feel bad Nani, but really Biren Bhai is the reason why I think ants are better than uncles.\u2019\nMy poor pun literally falls on deaf ears as Nani has left her hearing aid at home, so off I go to grab, if not the tallest, but definitely the largest drink I can get.\nSometimes you do need to pour some Scotch on the rocks to fill your jar of well-being right up to the brim.\nThis blog was originally published in Times Of India.\nOriginally Published In The Times OF India", "title": "Twinkle Khanna Takes A Dig At Building Of Tall Statues & Ignoring Air Quality Index In Her Blog", "date_publish": "11/11/2018, 13:28:42", "description": "11.45 am I am making insecticide by mixing sugar powder with boric acid when my nani calls, \u2018Biren Bhai is arriving from Surat today.
