{"text": "Post anything on social media and if it is controversial or shocking, it will go viral \u2013 even if it\u2019s fake. This man just proved the aforementioned with his tweets. With the advent of social media, it has become easy to share information \u2013 both true and false. But how do we spot what\u2019s fake and what\u2019s real?\nTV writer Ben Mekler conducted an experiment on Twitter. He posted some outrageous comments about recently released movies. He wanted to see if the major websites will pick them up. They indeed did, but they were all fake comments.\nTwitter\nIt all started with Avengers: Infinity War. The craze of the film was so high that almost everyone was talking about it. Ben Mekler also posted a fake review, which surprisingly was carried by a lot of entertainment portals. In the tweet, he wrote, Iron Man and Captain America have sex in the movie.\nDon't Miss 4.3 K SHARES 130 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\nJust got out of the #AvengersInfinityWar premiere. The movie is incredible, epic beyond compare. It\u2019s everything you want it to be. Iron Man and Captain America fuck within the first fifteen minutes. Marvel fans are going to love this one - EASILY top five. \u2014 Ben Mekler (@benmekler) April 24, 2018\nIn the fake review of Captain Marvel, he wrote, \u201c#CaptainMarvel is RADICAL! An awesome 90s period piece & total recalibration of the MCU as we know it! From the brief Winter Soldier cameo to the six full episodes of Friends that play consecutively through a majority of the film\u2019s runtime, this might be my favorite MCU flick yet.\u201d\n#CaptainMarvel is RADICAL!

He again posted a fake movie review for Disney\u2019s Dumbo. \u201c#DUMBO soars. My favorite live-action Disney remake yet! From the gorgeous blend of goth and whimsy to the sequence in which Dumbo replaces his trunk with a 32 inch machete and has an affair with a bored housewife, the Tim Burton we know and love is FINALLY back in full force,\u201d he wrote.\n#DUMBO soars.

Cast crushed it - true to what we know yet energetic, fresh. Only subpar thing - at least forty minutes wasted on scenes where characters wolf down raw vidalia onions? Third act drags too. Still, this is a REAL Star Wars movie - loved it \u2014 Ben Mekler (@benmekler) May 11, 2018\n#Aquaman is everything DC fans have been hoping for and more. Rollicking action, an amazing sense of world-building, spellbinding musical numbers in which Aquaman wears clams as tap shoes, and a command performance from Jason Momoa. DC has really righted the ship. The DCEU lives! \u2014 Ben Mekler (@benmekler) November 26, 2018\nThank you MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT for making me audibly gasp in a theater for the first time in ages. Won\u2019t soon forget the image of Tom Cruise squeezing pus out of a festering wound while shrieking \u201cI have to do this\u201d directly into the lens. I. LOVE. THESE. MOVIES. \u2014 Ben Mekler (@benmekler) July 12, 2018\nSo, are you looking forward to what he has to say about Avengers: Endgame?
