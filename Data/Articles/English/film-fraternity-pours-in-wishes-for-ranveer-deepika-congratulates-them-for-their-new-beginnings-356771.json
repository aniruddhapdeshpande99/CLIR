Not because they are two of the most popular Bollywood stars, but because it will remind us of the fact that love triumphs all.\nAfter a rock steady relationship of six years, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone solemnized their relationship by marrying in Italy's Lake Como.\nWhile the celebrations were spread over three-four days with close family and friends making a cut into the guest list, 14th-15th were the days when the couple started their official journey together by following both Sindhi and Konkani rituals.\nThe entire country was waiting with baited breaths to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds and after grainy back shots, Ranveer-Deepika obliged us by giving us an opportunity to be a part of their celebrations. While privacy remained one of the key highlights of this destination wedding, both Ranveer-Deepika decided on sharing this private moment by posting pictures on their social media.\nThe pictures were out by 8 pm on 15th and within seconds the social media platforms exploded with wishes for the couple.\nInstagram/Ranveer and Deepika\nDon't Miss 460 SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES\nApart from trending on these platforms, the film fraternity joined the #DeepVeer fan-club and poured their heartiest wishes for the couple.
