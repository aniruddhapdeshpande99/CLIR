Even after Hardik Pandya\u2019s public apology, BCCI has imposed a temporary ban on the cricketer. While the sexist and misogynistic comments were passed by Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul laughed them off as 'jokes'. Of course, that gave rise to a massive outrage that no one\u2019s forgetting anytime soon.\nNow, the internet has dug up an old video of Ranveer Singh on the same show, Koffee With Karan, in which he is making some cringe-worthy remarks. And yet again, Karan Johar is laughing his heart out at them. Take a look!\n\u201cYou want your ass pinched? I\u2019m right here,\u201d he says in one of the videos.\n\"You want your ass pinched? I'm right here\" IS THIS YOUR HERO? Also look at how Kjo is laughing.
