Anushka Sharma And Her Doppelganger Julia Michaels\u2019 Reaction On Seeing Each Other\u2019s Picture Is Priceless\nHow would you react on seeing someone who looks uncannily similar to you? I would be fascinated but at the same time creeped out too.\nBut because it\u2019s a big damn world, most of us might never come across our own doppelgangers. However, in case of a celebrity, when your face is plastered almost everywhere including social media, it doesn\u2019t take much effort to spot a look-alike.\nThat\u2019s what happened recently. After Salman Khan\u2019s doppelganger was spotted in Karachi, Pakistan, Anushka Sharma\u2019s look-alike was found in America. And not just a random person, but Anushka Sharma looks quite similar to American singer Julia Michaels.\nDon't Miss 3.4 K SHARES 518 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\nAfter the picture went viral, fans were shook.\nUnbelievable \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00 \u2014 Pawan Tiwari (@pawanerp) February 4, 2019\nWell, not only fans, Julia Michaels was shocked at this too. So much so, that she decided to tweet to Anushka Sharma. Sharing the collage of side-by-side picture with her, she wrote, \u201cHi @AnushkaSharma apparently we\u2019re twins lol.\u201d\nAnushka Sharma was quick to notice this. In her response, she wrote, \u201cOMG YES!! I've been looking for you and the remaining 5 of our dopplegangers all my life.\"\nOMG YES!! \ud83d\ude32 I've been looking for you and the remaining 5 of our dopplegangers all my life \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/SaYbclXyXt \u2014 Anushka Sharma (@AnushkaSharma) February 5, 2019", "title": "Anushka Sharma\u2019s doppelganger:Anushka Sharma And Her Doppelganger Julia Michaels\u2019 Reaction On Seeing Each Other\u2019s Picture Is Priceless", "date_publish": "06/02/2019, 11:13:06", "description": "Anushka Sharma\u2019s doppelganger tweeted to her.
