I have started doing some good things and I want all of you to support me in this instead of creating controversies around my comments.\u201d He added that Archana Puran Singh shot a few episodes with the team of his show because Sidhu Ji had some prior commitments.\nTwitter\nAfter his comment received backlash and became controversial, Navjot Singh Sidhu had clarified his stance saying that his remark was \u201cdistorted\u201d and that \u201cMere liye hamesha hi desh pehle tha (For me the country had always been first)\u2026\u201d.
