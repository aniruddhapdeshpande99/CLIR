More often than, it is an old thing and after 10 or 15 years it gets very difficult to prove. Also, these things happen in private so there is no witness. You have to take the word. Somebody could be lying, it's difficult to gauge. But I feel because of this movement, a person will think 100 times before doing something. They will be scared to do something, this is one thing that the movement has definitely done.\n\"See there are lots of people who will take advantage of this movement, which is obvious, but one good thing is that this movement has created a fear in men that if they do anything wrong to a girl, she will raise her voice, instead of staying mum.\"\nTwitter\nRecalling the days she faced all this harassment, Neena narrates, \u201cI lost lots of work because of this, but once I gathered the courage and spoke about it. I was very new and somebody told me a very bad thing which I couldn\u2019t tolerate. I was disgusted, he told me such dirty things in front of everyone because I was not giving it. I was very angry and I spoke about it in some of the magazines. It did not deter him, he again spoke bad about me. He was very powerful and I was nothing as I was very new, we continued fighting and it became very dirty. My friends advised me to stop. The told me that nobody will believe me, he is not getting affected, I will lose my respect because I was a nobody, so after that I said nothing. Afterwards, whenever something like this used to happen, I would leave the project, never go back on sets and dealt with it quietly.\u201d\nTwitter\nLooking at the view from her balcony and thinking out loud, she said, \u201cI wish I was younger at this time. I would have done so much, today\u2019s youngsters are so different, they are so much into their work. There is no hanky panky, it\u2019s a very different atmosphere with the youngsters.\u201d\nInstagram\nBadhai Ho actress' one wish that cannot be fulfilled is to do a film like Gone With The Wind as she is old, but her mantra is to move on, \u201cMy life's mantra is to move on, I have always moved on, thik hai something bad happens, you cry, you drink, you shop, but eventually you have to move on\u201d.\nInstagram\nThis woman is indeed one of a kind.
