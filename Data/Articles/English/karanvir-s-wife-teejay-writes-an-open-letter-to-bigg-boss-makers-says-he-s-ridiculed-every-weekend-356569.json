{"text": "Bigg Boss 12 has reached its mid season and now the show is picking up with intense tasks, fights between contestants and Weekend Ka Vaar. Despite the pressure, celebrity contestants Dipika Kakar, Srishti Rode and Karanvir Bohra try and stick together during the show.\nScreengrab\nHowever, not everyone is pleased with Karanvir's captaincy and how he won it during the bowl task inside the show. While Dipika was called an unfair sanchalak, some called it KV's game plan. But many outside the house have come out in support of Karanvir realising that during the Weekend Ka Vaar, the celebrity contestant is ridiculed by the host Salman Khan, not once but multiple times.\nInstagram/Teejay Sindhu\nAnd it certainly hasn't gone down well with Karanvir's wife Teejay Sindhu. The TV actress and mother of two has written an open letter after watching the latest episode of Bigg Boss 12.\nDon't Miss 812 SHARES 3 K SHARES 4 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES\nIt is out of concern, and with the utmost respect that I write to you..

She has lashed out at the makers and and even apologized if KV has done something wrong to deserve this.\nTwitter/Teejay Sindu\nTaking an instance from this Weekend Ka Vaar, Teejay mentioned how Salman Khan taunted Karanvir saying there's no fizz left in him. Salman has apparently hurt not only Teejay but celebs from the TV fraternity as well.\nTwitter/Teejay Sindu\nNow TV celebs and Karanvir's fans have come together on social media in support of Teejay and KV. While some want Bigg Boss shut, some want Salman to be kinder to Karanvir.
