India biz. #Uri #HowsTheJosh \u2014 taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) January 14, 2019\nIn conversation with Indiatimes, Vicky spoke about the success of Uri, his game changer film, stardom and more.\nTo begin with, he spoke about Uri\u2019s success. Feeling thankful, Vicky said, \"This kind of response was pleasantly surprising for all of us, we were hoping to get a good response but we didn\u2019t think that even Friday evening shows would be full and the numbers will be so good. The claps are the biggest compliment for me from the audience; you get the claps in the theatres only when they feel connected.\u201c\nWe quizzed him what excites him as an actor and he said, \u201cI get excited when I do not have dialogue luxury to express my feelings, but still I have to express my feelings, so as an actor, there is a scope of proving yourself and it is a self-test period too.\u201d.\nDon't Miss 233 SHARES 870 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES\nThe Best Phase Where I'm Getting Good Directors And Amazing Scripts\nNow Vicky has made his mark in the list of bankable actor and whatever he touches is turning into gold. So how is he planning to encash it, to which he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I need to encash it. I will continue the same process of my work like I have been doing it, I want to be truthful to my work and that\u2019s very important for me. But now is the time, I cannot lose focus, I cannot take this success for granted, I have to put a lot more hard work, I will not take success or failure very seriously, It\u2019s a good phase for me where I am getting to work with good directors and good scripts. \u201c\nInstagram\nNever Want To Be Stereotyped\nThe actor reveals how after Masaan, he got the offers in the same genre, but he never did that and rather chose a totally opposite film.\n\u201cI have been selective from the beginning. After Masaan, I got a lot of roles based out of UP or Bihar, which I tried to stay away from. Then I did a film like Raman Raghav, where I knew, it is not for the masses, but at least I will get to show that I can do a lot more. I never wanted to be to be stereotyped. I always believe that Industry or audience don't stereotype you; it\u2019s you who make yourself, that\u2019s your choice. I always try to be different from my on-screen characters; I never want to repeat myself. Even now I am shooting for a horror film, so that\u2019s my agenda, that I do everything, rest is destiny.\u201d\nTwitter\nSanju Was Definitely A Game Changer\nVicky feels Sanju bought him all the fame, \u201cMasaan gave me a lot of credibility, because it was such an underdog film, nobody had any expectation from it, but when it came, people were surprised. Masaan opened a lot of doors for me, but with Sanju, I could reach every audience\u2019s house, I got a bigger base and spread with Sanju.\u201d\nInstagram\nFor Me, The Only Hero In A Film Is The Script\nVicky has done multi-starrer and two hero films too, when asked if he is looking forward to do a solo hero film, he said, \u201cI want to be a part of the film where a script is the hero and nothing else. My conscious effort is to not repeat myself, If I have done that genre, I don\u2019t want to follow it immediately, I will take a break from it, that\u2018s the first aspect. And the other thing is when I read a script, I don\u2019t read it as an actor, I try to listen to or read an audience, I think in my mind that I have paid 300 rupees for this film, so after the reading, if I feel that I should tell about this story to more people, and I get excited by the character, then I will do it or else I won\u2019t do it. \u201c\nInstagram\nIt's A Privilege In This Industry To Be Pressurized\nNow that Vicky has become a huge star, there is a lot of expectations from him as an actor. \u201cThere is a pressure and it\u2019s a good pressure because that pressure will bring the best work out of me. And I have worked very hard to get that pressure on me, because being pressured by the audience is a privilege because if there is no pressure means they don\u2019t love you and don\u2019t care about you. I have knocked 1000 of doors to get this pressure; I am not letting this go.\u201d", "title": "After The Success Of Uri, Vicky Kaushal Promises To Never Take His Stardom For Granted", "date_publish": "14/01/2019, 13:55:41", "description": "To begin he spoke about Uri\u2019s success, he said,\u201d This kind of response was pleasantly surprising for all of us, we are hoping to get a good response but we didn\u2019t think that even Friday evening shows will be full and the numbers will be so good.
