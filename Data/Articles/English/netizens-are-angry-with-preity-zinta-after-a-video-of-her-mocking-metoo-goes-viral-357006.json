The video that is being circulated on the website shows how Preity has mocked the movement and cracked a joke around #MeToo. Listen in.\nPreity Zinta's comments didn't go down too well with people. Slamming her for mocking the movement and putting across 'regressive' views, here is what Netizens had to say.\nPreity Zinta is the only woman I have ever heard wish that she'd been molested, harassed or assaulted so she'd have a story to tell. \u2014 Aavi (@poisonaavi) November 19, 2018\nDisturbing opinions coming from Preity Zinta on #MeToo movement. Highly insensitive the way she's going about mocking victims. \"You are treated the way you want to be\"- Sure @realpreityzinta, you wanted to be molested by Ness Wadia, right? That's why you filed an FIR against him? pic.twitter.com/AHvpEbF0jv \u2014 \u0c39\u0c3f\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c48\ud83c\udf08 (@Oxynom) November 17, 2018\nDon't Miss 881 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\n\u201cPeople treat you the way you want to be treated,\u201d says @realpreityzinta about survivors of sexual harassment.\nShocking victim-blaming while discussing #MeTooIndia\u2014watch why women like #PreityZinta are part of the problem: pic.twitter.com/V1oG9DYvBu \u2014 Vishal Choradiya (@VishalChoradiya) November 19, 2018\nCringing and embarrassed as I watch this Preity Zinta Interview.\n1. She filed a case of molestation against Ness Wadia in 2014. Yet, she says she\u2019s never had a #MeToo moment?\n2. @iFaridoon stop capitalising on this movement for views! First Rakhi Sawant, now this. STOP! https://t.co/YnHl1UtEib \u2014 Janice Sequeira (@janiceseq85) November 19, 2018\n\"personally do you ever had this experience (harassment)?\"\n\"i wish i had\"\nfuck you preity zinta, you're a piece of shit https://t.co/i3VZfXpn5b \u2014 hiba (@zayndeprived) November 18, 2018\nSo Miss #PreityZinta said that people who complain about the #MeToo are the ones who project that image about themselves and ask for it.\nSo according to your privileged ass, I was asking for it at 8 years old when I got molested, huh? \u2014 Sharanya Paulraj \ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffd (@sharusays) November 18, 2018\n#PreityZinta when people tell you, you are bubbly you don't have to literally be that cheerful and forcefully crassy while talking about something sensitive as #metoo Demeaning it by wishing you had such an experience? Lost a lot of respect for you. \u2014 Ankita (@_downandirty_) November 19, 2018\nThis is how people change. The same Preity Zinta would probably be the champion of #Metoo if the movement happened during time when she had a fallout with Ness Wadia https://t.co/Pifl6Int52 \u2014 Deepika Bhardwaj (@DeepikaBhardwaj) November 19, 2018\nNo wonder Aman pushed you to another guy and died instead https://t.co/BMunvU85ON \u2014 not a damsel, but in distress (@KiskuGhoorra) November 18, 2018\nAfter she was slammed for her views, she said that she was \u2018surprised\u2019 and \u2018upset\u2019 that her interview was edited to sound controversial for better traction.\nShe wrote, \"Really sad 2see how the interview Is edited to trivialise & be insensitive.\"\nReally sad 2see how the interview Is edited to trivialis& be insensitive. Not everything is traction & as someone being interviewed I expected decency & maturity froma journalist @iFaridoon. I did 25 interviews that day & only yours turned out edited like this #dissappointed \u2014 Preity G Zinta (@realpreityzinta) November 19, 2018\nScreengrab\nHer video has spread like wildfire and maybe it's too late for her to apologize or blame someone else.
