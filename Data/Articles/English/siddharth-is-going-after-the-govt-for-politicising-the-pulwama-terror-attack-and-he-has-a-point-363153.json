Attacking primarily the opposition, PM Modi said,\nDon't Miss 837 SHARES 862 SHARES 346 SHARES\n\u201cFirst, they (Opposition parties) asked for surgical strike proof. Now, they have even started asking for proof of the air strike by the Indian Air Force. Why are Congress and its allies demoralising our forces? Why are they giving statements which are benefiting our enemies.\u201d\nIt is natural that we all should believe the armed forces and be proud of the forces.\nYet, I don\u2019t understand why some people still want to question the forces: PM @narendramodi \u2014 PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 4, 2019\nThe same was tweeted by PMO India twitter handle. This tweet received mixed reactions but Sidhaarth couldn't help but retort to this. Slamming the PM and his government, Siddharth said,\nOur people believe and stand by the armed forces. It's you and your gang they don't believe. Stop politicizing #Pulwama. Stop pretending to be heroes on the backs of real heroes. You should respect the forces. You are not a soldier. Don't expect to be treated like one. Jai Hind. https://t.co/SEwI1Zw5Bh \u2014 Siddharth (@Actor_Siddharth) March 4, 2019\n\"Our people believe and stand by the armed forces.
