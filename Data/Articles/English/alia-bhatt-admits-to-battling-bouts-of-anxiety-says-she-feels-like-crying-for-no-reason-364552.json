{"text": "Depression, anxiety and mental illness are a real thing. It\u2019s like any other medical illness. Many people think that they are merely sad or there are just over-thinking. But sometimes, it could be a serious condition that needs your attention.\nYouTube\nAlia Bhatt who played the role of girl who is discontented with her life and meets a free-spirited psychologist who helps her to gain a new perspective on her life, recently admitted that she is getting bouts of anxiety in real life as well. She earlier thought it was work-pressure, but speaking to her friends made it easier for her not to evade reality.\nTwitter\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been depressed but I\u2019ve had bouts of anxiety. It comes and goes. It\u2019s been happening quite a bit since the past five to six months. It\u2019s not like an anxiety attack but I just feel low,\u201d she told Filmfare.\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 336 SHARES 247 SHARES 699 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\nAlia Bhatt seems to be having it all \u2013 a great career, a loving partner and also a huge fan following, but she says she is suffering from anxiety too. Talking about how she deals with it, here\u2019s what she said.\nYouTube\n\u201cNo matter how bad it is, I just let myself feel it. Sometimes, I feel like crying for no reason. Then it passes. Initially, I\u2019d be a little confused. I\u2019d constantly give reasons that it\u2019s because of work or maybe I\u2019m tired or haven\u2019t been able to meet anyone... The kind of personality I have, I become a little on the edge. I spoke to friends about it. I spoke to Ayan (Mukerji, director) about it, I spoke to my sister\u2019s friend Rohan (Joshi). Everyone told me that you\u2019ve got to realise that it will go away. What\u2019s important is to accept it and not say that you\u2019re fine. If you\u2019re not feeling fine, then you should just say you\u2019re not feeling fine.\u201d\nInstagram\nFor the unversed, Alia Bhatt\u2019s sister Shaheen Bhatt has fought depression. She even wrote a book titled \u2018I've Never Been (un)Happier\u2019 in which she shared her experience of coming out of it.
