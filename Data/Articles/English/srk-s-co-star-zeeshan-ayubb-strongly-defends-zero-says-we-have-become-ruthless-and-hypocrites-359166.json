We should give it to him for that. We have become ruthless and sometimes hypocrites also. Just a few days ago, I was saying that \u2018I know I have been doing the same kind of characters, getting a tag of being the hero\u2019s friend. Now, if somebody else has tried something, why are we after his life\u201d.\nThe actor admitted that Zero isn\u2019t a great film, but we all should give a little time to it,\n\u201cI am not saying that Zero is a great film. I think everybody has the right to say that they didn\u2019t like the film and there are problems. All of us know where the film lacks, but I think it\u2019s getting mixed (reactions).
