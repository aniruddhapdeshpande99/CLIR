She made her Bollywood debut with Aamir Khan in Dangal, and Fatima Sana Shaikh has said she believes we won\u2019t get superstars after the Khans. Describing how accessible actors are i today\u2019s digital age, Fatima says,\n\u201cThe superstar era ended way back. After the \u2018Khans\u2019, I don\u2019t think we will ever have superstars. Now we all are accessible but earlier the stars were not. We could not search them on social media or follow their lives. We were able to connect with them through their films and interviews.\u201d\nafp\nFatima, who started her journey in the movies as a child actor with Kamal Haasan\u2019s 1997 film Chachi 420, says the rejections shifted her focus from waiting for a conventional lead role to searching for a good character.\n\u201cI have been a child actor. I quit but making a comeback after that was difficult. I was not getting any work. People used to tell me I don\u2019t look like Deepika Padukone or Katrina Kaif. They said, since I didn\u2019t have the looks of a heroine, I should do whatever I\u2019m offered. There have been many incidents where I was told that I was not good enough,\u201d Fatima said.\nThe actor says her desire to perform in front of the camera was so strong that she did not pay heed to what people thought of her. \u201cI only had acting on my mind. The reason why I used to go for every audition was because I would get to perform in front of the camera, even if the set-up was small.\u201d\nafp\nDon't Miss 812 SHARES 343 SHARES 3 K SHARES 555 SHARES 4 K SHARES\nThe success of Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal, however, made things easier for Fatima as it gave her the option to choose.\n\u201cBefore Dangal, I never had the chance to choose my projects. I even did \u2018Dangal\u2019 because that was my only option at that time. Every actor goes through this. That\u2019s how things function. But I am happy that post the film and especially after Thugs of Hindostan, I have the space to choose,\u201d she says.\nCiting an example of Rajkummar Rao, her co-star from Anurag Basu\u2019s upcoming anthology, the actor says there is no formula for success. \u201cThere is no single rule that applies to everyone. But now there are so many opportunities because of Netflix, Amazon and other platforms.\nInflux of different mediums has given actors a lot more options.\u201d Fatima says even though her aim is to establish herself as a sought-after performer, she does not believe in planning \u201ctoo much\u201d.\n\u201cWhere I want to reach it might take two or maybe six years. But I am happy that at least I\u2019m on my way. Before \u2018Thugs...\u2019 I was a very competitive person I would keep a check on who is wearing what and what they were doing. But I realised everybody has a different fate and there is no point in following anyone\u2019s journey,\u201d she adds.\nFatima adds the only way the actors of her generation could survive is by doing good work. \u201cThe moment we do good work, we get appreciation and when we don\u2019t things go the other way. Actors like Deepika have been in the industry for so long, but it is now that people have realised she is a very good actor because of her choices.\u201d\nInputs From PTI", "title": "Fatima Sana Shaikh Has A Valid Point On Why We Will Never Have Superstars After The Khans!", "date_publish": "25/03/2019, 17:28:01", "description": "She made her Bollywood debut with Aamir Khan in Dangal, but Fatima Sana Shaikh has said she believes we won\u2019t get superstars after the Khans.
