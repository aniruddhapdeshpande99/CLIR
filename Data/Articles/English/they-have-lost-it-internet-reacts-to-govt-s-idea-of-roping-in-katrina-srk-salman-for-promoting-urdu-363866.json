Today, the internet is busy criticizing and slamming the government's plan of roping in Indian actors Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif and Shah Rukh Khan to promote Urdu language in India.\nTwitter\nConfused? Well, same here! As per reports, Ministry of Human Resource Development's autonomous body National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language (NCPUL) is planning to rope in superstars like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif to endorse the language.\nWhat is NCPUL?\nIt publishes books in Urdu, organises conferences at national and international level and offers diploma courses in Arabic and Urdu to promote the language. They have been facing challenges from private players, who have been organizing successful events for promotion of Urdu and draw massive crowds of young people.\nTheir whole idea is to attract more and more people towards Urdu by getting Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan to recite a few lines in Urdu and recording it. These videos later could be used as an effective promotional strategy. Reacting to whole idea, Social media seems angry at the whole idea of bringing Salman and Katrina onboard for promoting the language.\nDon't Miss 812 SHARES 343 SHARES 3 K SHARES 555 SHARES 699 SHARES\nAgencies\nHere are some angry tweets that prove that people are not sold with the whole idea of roping in Bollywood stars for it.
