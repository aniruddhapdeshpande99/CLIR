The entire world showered their, love and blessings to the newlywed.\nHowever, one online entertainment portal wasted no time in spewing venom on PC and Nick\u2019s wedding as it labeled our desi girl - a global scam artist. No points for guessing, that this piece of writing obviously didn\u2019t go down well with all her fans and near and dear ones. The racist and sexist article on Priyanka went viral and received a lot of backlash. So much so, the portal was forced to take down the article and even apologize for their blunder, as they were receiving so much hatred from people all around the globe.\nTwitter\nPriyanka, who soon after her marriage hosted an event of an app launch along with hubby Nick was asked about the viral article on her, she took it sportingly and answered like a true diva,\nDon't Miss 161 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 186 SHARES 161 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\n\"I don't even want to react or comment.
