If you think that\u2019s because he gets lost into the conversation, you might want to take another guess.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not talking. It\u2019s just watching. I like to watch and observe how they move. I\u2019m little from the black side so I need to see how they move,\u201d he said on Koffee With Karan\u2019s latest episode, and received immense amount of flak for his misogynistic remarks.\nHardik Pandya : When i lost my virginity, i told them, \"Mai Aj kar kay aya ho\" pic.twitter.com/6HfX0zRWHy \u2014 Thakur (@ThakurHassam) January 6, 2019\nHe was forced to apologise, but when he did that, his apology, people thought wasn\u2019t sincere enough.\nMr. Talwar gets it right. pic.twitter.com/OCMXSgCXHA \u2014 Drupad Dave (@DrupadSays) January 9, 2019\nBCCI is troubled after this incident. It served the two cricketers a show-cause notice for their crass and misogynistic remarks since it triggered a massive outrage. Furthermore, BCCI is currently in a legal dilemma on whether it should ban Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul for two matches or not. Barely 24-hours before India had to line-up their playing eleven, BCCI is still confused over the quantum of punishment that shall be granted to the two cricketers.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES\nOn the other side, Hotstar, which is the online streaming partner for the show, has taken down the episode of Koffee With Karan featuring KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya.
