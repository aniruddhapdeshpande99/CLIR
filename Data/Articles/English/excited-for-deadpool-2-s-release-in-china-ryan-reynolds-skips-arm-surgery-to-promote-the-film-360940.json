The recut version of the film has finally passed the Chinese rigorous censorship standards, and Ryan Reynolds is quite excited about it.\nHe flew to China on Sunday to enthrall all the Deadpool fans, reports variety.com. Last week, Fox suddenly announced that a re-cut, PG-13 Deadpool 2 would hit Chinese theaters starting this Friday - the first time the franchise has passed the country's strict censorship standards.\nReuters\nThe Beijing visit by Reynolds, who is Canadian, comes at a time when Sino-Canadian relations are at a historic low following the arrest in December of Huawei Technologies CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver, with China detaining two Canadians in apparent retaliation.\nA third Canadian was sentenced to death at a sudden retrial of his drug-smuggling case in a move that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called \"arbitrary\" and a cause for \"extreme concern.\" None of that seemed to faze Reynolds.\nDon't Miss 623 SHARES 158 SHARES 2.4 K SHARES 2.2 K SHARES 120 SHARES\n\"It's been a dream of mine for years to bring 'Deadpool' to China and Chinese audiences, so for me this is, uh, heaven on earth,\" he told his Beijing fans on a whirlwind one-day promotional visit.\nYoutube\nHe had injured his left arm shooting the film and was scheduled to undergo surgery in New York on Sunday morning but skipped the appointment.\n\"This was more important.
