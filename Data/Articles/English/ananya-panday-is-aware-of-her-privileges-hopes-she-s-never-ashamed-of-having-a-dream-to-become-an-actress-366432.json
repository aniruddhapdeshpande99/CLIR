{"text": "Ananya Panday's Student of the Year 2 trailer sparked the nepotism debate again. The best part about this heated discussion is that every star kid knows they are judged and constantly scrutinized even more because they belong to a 'filmy family'.\nTwitter\nIndiatimes met the newest star kid on the block, Ananya Panday who is chatty yet an intelligent woman. She spoke to us about the criticisms the trailer has received and the nepotism debate.\nViral Bhayani\nFirstly we asked Ananya about the criticism around Student of The Year 2 trailer, she said, \u201cI agree with these people, there is no school like that, but we never claimed we are making a documentary on students in schools. We have always maintained a masala popcorn and an entertainer flick. I hope people see SOTY 2 with that light because it\u2019s a fun film and we just want people to come and enjoy. I feel in life there are so many pressures, especially in real schools, like I was a student and I know, I was going through so many issues. We had so many problems, body issues, and all that stuff, so I feel when you are going to watch the film, you will want to forget all your problems, because we are making the film to make people happy.\u201d\nDon't Miss 1.1 K SHARES 207 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.4 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES\nWe even asked Ananya about how people constantly compare star kids with normal actors trying to make a mark. Agreeing to it, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s fine for people to bring up this nepotism topic that\u2019s not random, it exists. I am very well aware of my privilege and I just hope that I can work hard. I hope people accept me and like my work because my dad has really worked very hard to get respect and get his name in the industry. I don\u2019t want to take anything away from him.\"\nViral Bhayani\nTwitter\nShe added, \"The only problem that I have with this nepotism debate is that it is adding a lot of negativity to my dad\u2019s name which I don\u2019t want. I want to build it on my own and if I can add anything to my dad, it should be positive so I just hope people watch the film, then they judge and make their decision.\u201d\nViral Bhayani\nShe even admitted of the easy access they have which the outsiders don\u2019t,\n\u201cI agree we have a lot of access. We can get into those rooms easily, but I think what you do in those rooms, the talent that you have is what speaks at the end of the day. No one is going to put their money on someone they don\u2019t believe in and I really want to justify my faith in people. I really hope that people feel I am talented and deserve to be here. This has been my dream all my life and I don\u2019t want to be ashamed that this was my dream, and I don\u2019t want to be ashamed of who my dad is ever. He has worked really hard to reach where he is.\"\nTwitter\nTalking about her aspiration as an actress, Ananya wants to be judged exactly like Alia Bhatt. She is grateful when people compare her to Alia Bhatt. \u201cI really look up to Alia, the way she has transformed from Student Of The Year, Gully Boy to Raazi. What I like about Alia was she never claimed to be perfect form the start. People have seen her grow, they have seen her doing Highway, an Udta Punjab and then a Raazi, I would like people to see me grow too. I don\u2019t want to be perfect from the start either. I want people to see me at that level and that feeling will be surreal for me.\u201d\nInstagram\nWell, only time will tell if Ananya will survive or not? But clearly, she deserves a chance.
