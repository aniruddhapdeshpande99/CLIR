{"text": "We have seen and heard endless debates around the reality behind reality shows. Even when the shows land in trouble for being rigged, the popularity of few of the shows remains unfazed.\nOne top show that has been ruling the small screen since ages are Bigg Boss. The 12th season of the show ended a few weeks before and TV actress Dipika Kakar took the trophy home.\nIf you thought that like every year, the story ends here, you're mistaken. A lot of fans forget to draw the line between admiration and obsession and this is exactly what has happened.\nA fan of Sreesanth (who also formed a close bond with Dipika on the show) took to social media to threaten her of acid attack. The troll further added that if he ever visits Mumbai, he will throw acid on her face. He wrote,\ncolors\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\"Kitna ghaitya aurat hai ye makki tu ekbar live re devorcy aurat tujhe kitna troll karenge tujhe pata nehi tera dipstar ne had kardi saree bohut bura kaha abhi tera personal life pe hum attack karenge dek lena tu aur main Mumbai main hun agar tu mujhe dik Jaye acid fekke marunga.\"\nTo bring this situation to control, a fan of Dipika took to Twitter to adress the tweet to Mumbai police.\nIn his tweet, he wrote,\n\"Dear @MumbaiPolice this guy is threatening to throw acid on lady...Please arrest him early as possible. Please RT and Spread so this post can reach to @MumbaiPolice. @CNNnews18 @RVCJ_FB @ZeeNews @aajtak @abpnewshindi @indiaforums @Spotboye @TheKhbri.\"\nWell, this isn't the worst news of the day. Fandom loses its meaning completely when instead of lending support, they take some extreme steps.\nDuring a radio show, Sreesanth had revealed how after losing the trophy to Dipika, one of his fans even slit his wrist. He wrote,\n\"After coming out of the house, I came to know that so many people were disappointed because I didn't win the show. A lot of people cried and someone even slit their wrist. I would like to say that for me or for the trophy please don't cut your hand. You have do a lot of things with that hand. A lot of people did a lot of things but you guys should know that I am the real winner, not just in Bigg Boss 12 but in real life.\"\nWhere are we heading? The aggression on such trivial issues is so intense that it's appalling!", "title": "The 'Harsh' Reality Of Reality Shows: Sreesanth's Fan Threatens To Throw Acid On Dipika Kakar", "date_publish": "06/01/2019, 16:44:15", "description": "One top show that has been ruling the small screen since ages are Bigg Boss.
