{"text": "Bollywood has always managed to unleash unique varieties of talent. While some are conquering commercial cinema, others are content with bringing offbeat cinema to the mainstream. There are several laud-worthy examples of both the categories. One name that shines bright in the latter is Chitrangda Singh. She might not have a long filmography to boast about but she has sure left a lasting impression in the minds of cine-goers.\nEntering the world of glitz and glamour as a model in 1994, she did modeling projects with ICICI Bank, Alukkas Jewellery and then a music video. It was filmmaker Sudhir Mishra who noticed her and saw potential in her as an actress. In the year 2003, she made a scintillating debut with Mishra\u2019s Hazaron Khwahishein Aisi that made her get limelight in the true sense. Not only was she deemed as a promising actress, a lot of industry insiders predicted that she had the potential to pave her way to the top most league of the acting world. In fact, filmmaker Shekhar Kapur in an interview had said that she had outdone the legendary actress Smita Patil in her debut film itself.\nhotstar\nIndiatimes spoke to the Bazaar actress and discussed in length about her journey in the business.\nBecoming An Actor Was Never An Agenda\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nChitrangda Singh is a name synonymous with intelligence, creativity and impeccable acting abilities. After a phenomenal debut she got noticed by some of the top-notch movie makers who were keen to work with her. Talking us on a walk down memory lane, she reflected on her journey. She said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing journey. I hadn\u2019t planned on being an actor, I was modelling in college for some extra pocket money, and that led to me being cast in a music video. Sudhir Mishra happened to see my music video and offered me an audition and that\u2019s how Hazaron happened. But I love the creativity of film and would not want it any other way.\u201d\nOn being compared to Smita Patil after her very first film she said, \u201cBeing compared to Smita Ji is a huge compliment. I have always been a great admirer of her work and to have someone as accomplished as Shekhar Kapur saying that is truly very humbling.\u201d\nLife Has Been Full Of Twists And Turns But I\u2019m Happy With Where I Am Right Now\nIn introspection, we asked her about her evolution in both the professional world and personal life in the past decade and a half. She said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s been mixed because your personal and professional life intertwine. It\u2019s always something everyone needs to balance, and each one does it differently. I don\u2019t know if I could have done it differently but I\u2019m happy with where I am now.\u201d\nPeople Often Perceive An Actor To Be The Same In Real As He/She Is In Reel\nmy tube\nSingh has worked in different genres of films. While she stunned the audience with a Maya in Inkaar, she entertained us with Tanya in Desi Boyz. Speaking on whether this is a conscious decision or does this happen on its own, she said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different working on different characters. As an actor however, you should be able to essay different roles with conviction. People often think you have to be the same in reel and real life. But that\u2019s not true. I enjoy playing different characters who have different energies and motivations. Tanya in Desi Boyz was very different from Maya in Inkaar and both are way different from me in real life.\u201d\nIn This Era, It\u2019s Now Possible To Be A \u2018Film Person\u2019\ntwitter\nNot many know that the actress turned producer last year with biopic Soorma starring Diljit Dosanjh which went on to become a super-hit. She might not be actively working in front of the camera but she is definitely dabbling with the other aspects of movie-making business. In fact, she now has her eyes set on the director\u2019s chair as well. Speaking on the same, she said,\n\u201cSoorma was a great experience and I really enjoyed working on it. It was the highlight of my year. I believe that the way the industry has evolved, it is now possible to be a \u2018film person\u2019 rather than being put in a niche as an actor or producer or writer or director. You can do more than one simultaneously. And that\u2019s really great. So, I hope to direct one day, I have already ideas for scripts I\u2019d like to write and there is a web series I\u2019m considering strongly at the moment as an actor as well.\u201d\nI\u2019ve Worked With Great Co-Stars And Colleagues\npinterest\nThe past year presented not just some phenomenal movies but it also unveiled the dark evil that has always been lingering in the background. When asked if she ever experienced a #MeToo incident in her 15-year long career, she said,\n\u201cIn most cases I\u2019ve had great co-stars and colleagues so it\u2019s never really been an issue. I\u2019m glad that there was so much support in the industry in the one instance when it was.\u201d\nAll Of Us Need To Connect On A Simple Human Level\npinterest\nWhile we are experiencing an era of digital explosion, Chitrangda feels that we also need to work on the humanitarian aspects and care for each other as well. She says,\n\u201cIt\u2019s important I think to care for people. As our world is becoming increasingly tech friendly, and interactions have shifted so much to digital contact, I hope we continue to make an effort to connect on a simple human level directly as well.\u201d", "title": "Bollywood's Evolution To Life Beyond Internet, Chitrangda Singh Talks About Things That Matter", "date_publish": "22/01/2019, 12:11:03", "description": "It\u2019s been an amazing journey.
