{"text": "Since the time it was announced that a movie based on the life of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray is in the works, there was quite an uproar online.\nThe much-awaited trailer of the movie starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the titular role was released yesterday, and it just took hours for it to become the eye of the storm.\nThe biopic on late Shiv Sena chief not only received objections from Censor Board of Certification. According to the makers of the movie, CBFC raised objections on four dialogues and two scenes and have asked them to make necessary changes.\nAmid all this, politician Sanjay Raut, who has written the story of the film said that nobody can ban the movie on Thackeray. He said that CBFC, which has raised objections against the movie, will understand the vision.\n\u201cNobody can ban the film. It is the story of Thackeray.... How could someone stop that? Balasaheb banned many people during his time. Did you people forget that? How could CBFC decide what is right or wrong on saheb's life? Only family members know that. I am sure even the censor board will understand the vision of Balasaheb. They will take time, but they will understand,\u201d he told IANS.\nOn the other side, Tamil actor Siddharth who is best known for his role in Rang De Basanti, called out the film\u2019s trailer for being anti-south Indian. Here\u2019s what he said.\nNawazuddin has repeated 'Uthao lungi bajao pungi' (lift the lungi and *'#$ him) in the film #Thackeray. Clearly hate speech against South Indians... In a film glorifying the person who said it! Are you planning to make money out of this propaganda? Stop selling hate! Scary stuff! \u2014 Siddharth (@Actor_Siddharth) December 26, 2018\nDon't Miss 18.3 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES\nPost this, people were quick to point that the Hindi version of the trailer didn\u2019t have those controversial lines and that they were only a part of the Marathi trailer of the bi-lingual film.\nI understand a biopic should not be whitewashed. But the marathi version of the trailer seems to be glorifying hatred. Appalled at the different narratives of both versions. #Thackeray #ThackerayTrailer \u2014 Siddharth Jain (@SiddhJain28) December 26, 2018", "title": "\u2018Thackeray\u2019 Lands In Another Controversy, Actor Siddharth Calls The Trailer \u2018Anti-South Indian\u2019", "date_publish": "27/12/2018, 12:00:46", "description": "Since the time it was announced that a movie based on the life of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray is in the works, there was quite an uproar online.
