{"text": "2018 was one great year for Ranveer Singh. From beginning the year with Padmaavat to ending it with Simmba, the actor was on a roll. Apart from this, he made headlines for his marriage with his girlfriend of six years Deepika Padukone.\nAgencies\nIn a recent interview, Ranveer Singh opened up about being aware of how this fame can affect a person\u2019s outlook.\nTalking to PTI, he said,\nAgencies\n\u201cWhen this happens around you, there are two possibilities \u2013 you either believe it or you are simply aware of it. While I am aware of it, I don\u2019t start believing in my own hype. My experiences have shaped me to be the kind of person I am.\"\nRanveer added that he keeps himself grounded by constantly reminding himself of his struggle period. He adds,\nAgencies\nDon't Miss 185 SHARES 544 SHARES 411 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\n\u201cI had a proper struggle period of three and half years, so today when opportunities come my way, I value them tremendously. I never lose sight because I have a vivid memory of the times when I had none of this.\"\nThe film industry is one of the most volatile places and an actor\u2019s sense of security is challenged every Friday, something that Ranveer says he has learned to deal with. He adds,\nAgencies\n\u201cI try and adopt the middle path \u2013 don\u2019t get too carried away with the success and don\u2019t get bogged down by failures. I feel happy when I succeed, you must do that. But then quickly immerse yourself in the current moment again. Filmmaking is a collaborative effort, so if it failed, it\u2019s not entirely your doing. I find this middle approach very healthy.\"\nThe 33-year-old actor says the child in him still considers his journey to success in Bollywood as a \u201cfairy tale.\u201d\n\u201cThis one kid, out of nowhere, had a dream and he\u2019s now living it. Every day my heart is filled with gratitude. I pray before I go to work and always say thank you because I value it. It is surreal what is happening to me, or around me. This love keeps me grounded and humbled. When fans ask me to get clicked with them, what I am actually thinking is \u2018What? Me? Do they really want to be clicked with me!'\u201d\n2019 also looks promising for the actor as he is gearing up for the release of Zoya Akhtar\u2019s Gully Boy. The poster of the film starring Alia Bhatt was released on Wednesday.\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "Ranveer Singh Simmba:Post Success Of Simmba, Ranveer Singh Talks About His 'Surreal' Stardom & How He Stays Grounded", "date_publish": "03/01/2019, 16:42:46", "description": "Post Success Of Simmba, Ranveer Singh Talks About His 'Surreal' Stardom & How He Stays GroundedPost Success Of Simmba, Ranveer Singh Talks About His 'Surreal' Stardom & How He Stays GroundedPost Success Of Simmba, Ranveer Singh Talks About His 'Surreal' Stardom & How He Stays Grounded", "authors": ["Isha Sharma"], "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/post-success-of-simmba-ranveer-singh-talks-about-his-surreal-stardom-how-he-stays-grounded-359787.html\n", "image_url": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Jan/ranveer_singh_1546515643_800x420.jpg"}
