She said,\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\"My first thought was to hide it because it was a disease. I thought my \u2018brand\u2019 is over\u2014all along I had been endorsing healthy eating and health-focused products, and suddenly it was all gone. It was only when my oncologist said that I had fourth-stage cancer and a 30 percent chance that my whole world view changed. Suddenly I didn\u2019t see any reason not to talk about it. I had done nothing wrong; it was not my fault I had cancer, so why was I hiding it?\u201d\nSonali believes in embracing all her scars and for her, cancer never meant hating her body. She said,\n\u201cI have a more loving relationship with my body for what it has gone through. I started thanking it for what it was doing\u2026 how it was healing itself and taking me forward. I\u2019m more comfortable with my body now and I don\u2019t want to unnecessarily stress it or have unrealistic goals. I\u2019m okay with some saggy, loose bits here, some cellulite there. I don\u2019t find it ugly anymore. In fact, I find it beautiful and I don\u2019t know when that shift happened.\u201d\nThat's not all. She shot for the same magazine and embracing all her flaws and scars, she also flaunted her 20 inch surgery scar. Have a look at the pictures.\nVogue India | Image: Photographed by R Burman.
