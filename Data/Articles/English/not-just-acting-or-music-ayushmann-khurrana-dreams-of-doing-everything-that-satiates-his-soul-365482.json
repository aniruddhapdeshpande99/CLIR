However, I always wanted to be an actor first and then a singer\u201d.\nTwitter\nRight now Ayushmann is the most talked about actor in the industry especially with the kind of films he is doing, we informed him how even Ranveer Singh feels why he isn\u2019t getting the kind of films Ayushmann is doing, to which the actor said, \u201c It\u2019s very kind of him to say that, but genuinely what I like, I do. I think success also depends on the people, how audience grasps your script, and how much they resonate with it, so I owe my success to the audience at the same time.\u201d\nTwitter\nWe asked him to reveal the secret mantra on choosing the right scripts, he said, \u201cMost of my decisions are impulsive, you must be thinking I think a lot before taking a decision but its impulsive, because your first reaction is the most organic reaction, be it first reaction to a script, song or any particular talent which I will see on this platform. I have a very intuitive reaction, that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s as simple as that, I think as an audience, I don\u2019t think like a star, jaise audience grasp karti hai kisi concept ko, mai waise hi karta hu.\u201d\nTwitter\nThe moment Ayushmann said he doesn\u2019t think like a star, we asked him if he has started feeling like a star, he said,\n\u201cSince you are giving successful films you think that you have become a star but you should not take it to your head that\u2019s the most important thing. If you have that connection with the audience, you have to be the audience, aapko unki tarah hi rehna padega and I have no other option but to do that because the kind of films that I am doing a middle of the road cinema and they deal with realism, so mujhe real hi rehna padega , that\u2019s my zone.\u201d\nTwitter\nThe man who has given back-to-back hits still craves to do a lot more in his life, \u201cI want to do everything, I want to produce, direct, compose more act more, have more beautiful scripts coming my way. I am very restless as an artist so I just crave to do every single thing which satiates my soul.\u201d\nBefore ending our interview we asked him what\u2019s his biggest fear, he said, \u201cI am very fearless, kyuki jis tarike ka risk mai leta lu cinema mai bhi aur apne life ke saath, so I feel I am quite happy go, lucky person\u201d.\nWe couldn\u2019t agree more.
