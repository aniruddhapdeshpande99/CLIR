{"text": "If you ask anyone their favourite comedy film from Bollywood, they would seldom forget to mention Andaz Apna Apna. The movie that gave Bollywood epic characters including Amar, Prem and Crime Master Gogo was released in 1994.

However, no substantial information in the same regard has come forth.\nGrapevine was buzz with rumour that Ranveer Singh and Varun Dhawan are likely to star in the film. People were worried if anyone would be able to do justice to the magic that Salman Khan and Aamir Khan had weaved in the original. Now it turns out, it is neither going to be a remake and nor a sequel, but a reloaded version of the film.\n\u201cThe producers Vinay and Priti Sinha are planning to do Andaz Apna Apna - it won\u2019t be a sequel or remake. Nor will Raj Kumar Santoshi direct it. While they have not decided yet what exactly it will be, they are sure it won\u2019t be a remake or sequel but something as exciting. Raj Kumar Santoshi\u2019s Andaz Apna Apna, starring Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor, was a cult movie and one cannot mess with the original. One should not touch such a great film and that too 25 years later and destroy it by a remake or sequel. The director is yet to be finalised,\u201d a source told Pinkvilla.\nDon't Miss 812 SHARES 185 SHARES 468 SHARES 207 SHARES\nThe movie will be set in 2019. Will it be laughter riot like the original?
