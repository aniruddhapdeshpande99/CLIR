On Monday, Alia Bhatt was asked to comment on people who are attacking online and taking digs at her and family members.\nReacting to this, Alia said,\n\"If I am mature then my family is 10 times more mature and stronger than I am. I don't want to get into this. I just want to be happy, positive, work hard, be a better version of myself every day. I should not pay attention to what people are saying.
