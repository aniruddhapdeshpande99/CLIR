Not only has he impressed the country (actually, the entire cricketing world) with his batting skills, but he has us charmed with his infinite other talents, good looks, and taste. We have seen him excel on the field and on our TV screens so far, and now the man has shown his impeccable designing abilities too!\nAs a part of PUMA\u2019s one8 collection, the Indian-skipper has designed these extremely trendy Basket Classic one8 sneakers. Having grown up loving the gentleman\u2019s game, he was determined to design his very first own sneakers as an old school classic. And that\u2019s exactly why he chose PUMA Basket.\nPUMA\nHe spent time with PUMA designers to create his own version of the classic sneaker and the results speak for themselves! The design of the shoes is very simple and minimal, much like his own style. And they even have elements of cricket in them- like the stitched details on these kicks are inspired by the seams of a cricket ball.\nSneakers are the it-thing in every body's wardrobe right now. And these kicks have the best of both worlds- a classic combination of style and comfort that everyone literally yearns for. The kicks are available in two neutral colours, white and black and so, are perfect to go with all outfits and occasions.\nPUMA\nAnd the man is rather excited about this launch, much like us!\nIf you\u2019re a true-blue Virat Kohli fan, you\u2019ve got to have your hands on these beauties! After all, they are 100% classic, 100% Virat! Head out to the nearest PUMA stores and get your hands on (feet in) these sneakers before they get sold out! I know, I won\u2019t miss out on them.", "title": "Virat Kohli Designed A Pair Of Sneakers And We Can't Wait To Get Our Hands On Them", "date_publish": "19/10/2018, 15:34:53", "description": "Virat Kohli is a youth icon and to say that he is only a cricket champion is a serious understatement to this man\u2019s capabilities.
