Don't cry and curse us for giving spoilers, instead go and watch the episode right away, and then come back here to read this insane theory, which could again be a possible spoiler for episode four.\nvia GIPHY\nThe dude is weird and creepy AF, don\u2019t you agree? I mean, when everyone is battling for their lives, Bran Stark plans to go warging. He keeps staring at people, and even being a crippled, he isn\u2019t scared of anyone. Not even the Night King.\nHotstar\nWhen the Night King was approaching him, we all were shitting bricks but Bran was sitting their without a care in the world. Ever wondered why?

He says:\n\u201cI think there\u2019s more going on than what meets the eye. Why else was Bran warged for so long? Could it be going back in time to prevent all this bloodshed? Could he have been making a deal with the Night King? When the Night King walked up to Bran, he looked like he accepted his fate. I just feel like the Night King is Bran, the Night King was going to kill Bran to destroy himself. I mean, the way the Night King just looked at Bran, it felt like he had to do it when he didn\u2019t want to. Arya ruined the plans for Bran.\u201d\nvia GIPHY\nAnd why, out of everyone, Bran wanted Theon Greyjoy, the man who isn\u2019t known for his bravery, to protect him. And then, he let Theon die. Is that because he didn\u2019t want any witness there?
