{"text": "Dilip Kumar is undoubtedly one of the greatest living legends of the Indian film industry. However, lately, he hasn\u2019t been keeping well. In past couple of years, he has been hospitalised for complaints of uneasiness, chest infection, dehydration and kidney malfunction several times.\nRumours are also rife that the legendary star who is known as the tragedy king cannot recognise anyone. \u201cHe cannot recognize anyone; sometimes, not even his own wife Saira ji. He can no longer walk or speak. He even needs to be carried to the bathroom. For all practical purposes, he's oblivious to the world around him,\u201d a source close to Daily Hunt had revealed.\nFilmmaker Subhash Ghai has also said that he cannot see him Dilip Kumar in such a state.\n\u201cI love Dilip sahab so much that I don't feel like meeting him anymore. I can't see him like this. When I see him, I feel like crying because we know each other since 20-22 years and I have loved him like my brother. He is unable to recognise me, he does not recognise anyone... He is becoming weaker and by looking at him, I think to myself that never 'be boastful in life',\u201d he was quoted as saying by IANS.\nAmid all this, Dilip Kumar is also dealing with another hassle. After alleged land mafia and builder Samir Bhojwani, who was earlier arrested for usurping her and the yesteryear susperstar\u2019s Pali Hill bungalow, was released from jail, Saira Banu approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi for help. She said that they are being threatened by the land mafia.\nIn an FIR lodged on January 4 this year, Saira alleged that Bhojwani, on the basis of forged documents, illegally staked ownership of land in Pali Hill, Bandra, the rights of which were acquired by Dilip Kumar on September 25, 1953.\nDon't Miss 235 SHARES 6.8 K SHARES 828 SHARES 776 SHARES\nRequest from Saira Banu Khan: To the Hon\u2019ble @PMOIndia Shri @narendramodi Awaiting for appointment. I am tired of repeated assurances from CM @Dev_Fadnavis \u201cI AM TRYING\u201c Sir you are the last hope of protecting DILIP SAHAB\u2019s only house from Land Mafia Samir Bhojwani. I beg \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Dilip Kumar (@TheDilipKumar) December 18, 2018\nTalking in the same regard, Saira Banu recently said, \u201cI want the Prime Minister to pay attention to this matter. Chief Minister (Devendra Fadnavis) is making efforts into this, we hope some good result will come after the Prime Minister also intervenes. Bhojwani is taking advantage of Dilip Sahab's illness.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Dilip Kumar's lawyer Chirag Shah claimed that Bhojwani is an affluent individual, adding, \"Opponent has great political connections and money power to file cases time and again even after losing so many times. After Saira ji's complaint, he was arrested for 130-132 days. It seems like apart from Saira and Dilip ji, he has harassed and cheated other people too.\"\nAfter Saira Banu tweeted to Prime Minister Modi, an official from the office of Fadnavis said the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) took note of the issue. Fadnavis also assured to look into the matter.\nWith inputs from ANI", "title": "Saira Banu Is Helpless, Says Land Mafia Is Threatening & Taking Advantage Of Dilip Kumar\u2019s Illness", "date_publish": "19/12/2018, 12:15:37", "description": "Dilip Kumar is also dealing with another hassle.
