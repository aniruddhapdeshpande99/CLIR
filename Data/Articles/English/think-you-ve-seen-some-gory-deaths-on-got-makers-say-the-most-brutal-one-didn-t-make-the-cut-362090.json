Makers Say The Most Brutal One Didn't Make The Cut!\nThe bloodier the deaths, the better. That\u2019s how the world of Game of Thrones operates. The American fantasy drama series is all about who gets killed and who survives.\nIf you think you have seen the most gruesome deaths on the show, you may be wrong. From Oberyn Martell\u2019s skull being crushed into pieces to Ramsay Snow\u2019s own dogs mauling him to death, from Ser Rodrik Casse being beheaded to Catelyn Stark\u2019s blood oozing out of her throat at the Red Wedding, it\u2019s all about blood and gore on GoT.\nBut do you know that the cruelest death of the show so far didn\u2019t make to the cut? Showrunner David Benioff, in conversation with Entertainment Weekly, revealed that this death of a character was so brutal and tragic that they decided to not showcase it.\nIt was the death of King Tommen's beloved cat, Ser Pounce.\nTwitter\n\u201cCersei hated the name 'Ser Pounce' so much she could not allow him to survive. So she came up with her most diabolical (execution). Ser Pounce's death was so horrible we couldn't even put it on the air,\u201d he said.\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 623 SHARES 264 SHARES 161 SHARES\nTo jog your memory a little, Ser Pounce wasn\u2019t liked by Joffrey Baratheon. He even threatened that he would skin the cat alive and mix its inwards up in Tommen's food, so he wouldn\u2019t even know that he would be eating his own pet. In Game of Thrones season 4, when Tommen succeeds as the king after Joffrey\u2019s death, and Margaery Tyrell sneaks into his room in order to get to know him better before Cersei turns him against her, Ser Pounce jumps on the bed and nuzzles up to Margaery.\nAlso Read: 9 Insanely Convincing \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Season 8 Theories That Will Pump You Up For The Finale", "title": "Think You've Seen Some Gory Deaths On GoT?
