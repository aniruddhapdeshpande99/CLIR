I DEMAND ANSWERS! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35 pic.twitter.com/b2TU26z55Y \u2014 Umar Ahmed (@TheUmarAhmed) April 15, 2019\nDon't Miss 159 SHARES 842 SHARES\n#3 Arya appeared from nowhere to kill the Night King.\nvia GIPHY\nIn the episode\u2019s climatic moment, Arya Stark pounces on him from nowhere and then stabs him, like it was child\u2019s play.\n#4 And then her mid-air hand-switch was just too much!\nvia GIPHY\nTo kill the Night King, Arya Stark pulls off a Michael Jordan-esque midair hand switch.

That was the final hint of a human emotion from the deadliest creature. For some, it was terrifying, and for others, it was funny.\n#6 Love was in the air during the war!\nvia GIPHY\nThe battle of life and death is going on, and strangely everyone is with their crushes. Tyrion and Sansa are discussing they could have made a better couple. Arya saves the Hound from White Walkers and then he saves her life later. Jorah Mormont and Danny are fighting the battle together. In fact, Jaime, Tormund and Ser Brienne of Tarth (the love-triangle) are also battling it out together.\nYou know, who was the only lonely person? Jon Snow. He didn\u2019t even get to kill the Night King. That wasn\u2019t fair, tbh.\n#7 It was such a big battle but no major character died. NONE.\nTwitter\nWhile fans were speculating that Arya, Jaime or Brienne Of Tarth might be dead in the biggest ever battle against the army of dead in Game of Thrones, none of the major characters died. All of them got lucky multiple times.\n#8 Everybody got drunk before the war because #JoHaiSamaKalHoNaHo!\nvia GIPHY\nTormund and Jaime were close to confessing their love for Brienne of Tarth under the influence of alcohol.

Why?\n#10 And what\u2019s up with Bran? And why the hell he had to warg during the battle?\nTwitter\nAnd the big question is where did he go? why nobody asks him any questions?\n#11 That piano background score during the last 20 minutes of the battle made it even more dramatic.\nBut honestly, it was amazing.
