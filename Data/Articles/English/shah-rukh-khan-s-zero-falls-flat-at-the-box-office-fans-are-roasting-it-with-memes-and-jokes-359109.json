After Harry Met Sejal, SRK\u2019s Zero is facing the heat of the audiences.\nBefore the release, people wondered if Zero will be another flop like Thugs Of Hindostan or a superhit like 2.0. But Aanand L Rai\u2019s romantic comedy failed to strike the right chord with the audiences.\nDespite good promotional strategies that included his character Bauua Singh popping out from different forms of media, Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s new-age film turned out to be a disaster for most of the people. The movie opened quite well at the box office (Rs 20 crore), but on the second day (Rs 16 crore) itself, the collections started to dip.\nEven Shah Rukh Khan fans are disappointed.
