Joining the bandwagon is actor Parvathy, who says it took her years to realize that she was assaulted as a child and that it\u2019s still a daily affair for her to consider herself a survivor.\n\u201cIt happened to me when I was very young. It took me 17 years to realise it did happen to me. I was three or four years old. I didn\u2019t ask for it. But I was assaulted. And then to speak about it, it took me another 12 years,\u201d Parvathy said at the Jio MAMI 20th Mumbai Film Festival with Star on Tuesday.\nShe added, \u201cTo sit and speak of it as a fact that has happened to me\u2026but not being defined by my gender. So, I sit here as a person first and then rest of the tags come in. But you know where the survival part comes\u2026 it\u2019s still a struggle for me on a daily basis to realise it, acknowledge it and get past it. It\u2019s a daily affair. And then let my friends know, my parents, cope with it. It becomes an extreme exercise on a daily basis.\u201d\nShe further added how she was brought up as a pretty confident and outspoken girl. Still, she wondered did she ask for it or did she deserve it.\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\u201cAs a personal experience, I know it\u2019s still a daily affair for me to consider myself a survivor.
