Recently, a lot of such cases have come to the light, where many have been outed as alleged perpetrators including Vikas Bahl and Alok Nath.\nThere are plenty who have been accused and plenty who have raised their voices. Here's what Bollywood stars have to say about the ongoing #MeToo movement that has become a revolution in India. Take a look:\n1. Amitabh Bachchan finally breaks his silence after avoiding the question earlier and getting severely bashed for the same.\nT 2959 - An interview on the eve of birthday : It is that special day again...special for us, that is. Why (cont) https://t.co/8n1ERaBtXw \u2014 Amitabh Bachchan (@SrBachchan) October 11, 2018\nNo woman should ever be subjected to any kind of misbehaviour, or disorderly conduct ; especially at her work place. Such acts should immediately be brought to the notice of concerned authorities, and corrective measures be taken, either through filing complaints or a recourse to law. Discipline and civic, social and moral curriculums, should be adopted at a very early educational level. Women children and the weaker sections of our society are the most vulnerable.\nDon't Miss 193 SHARES 862 SHARES 346 SHARES\nThey need to be under special protective care. It has been most heartening to see women representations in most work vocations, on the increase in our country. It would be an unrepairable blemish if we are not able to provide them the welcome they deserve and the dignity of the security of their presence.\n2. Asrani\nTwitter\nI support women, everyone should, but all this is mostly for publicity, part of film promotions and nothing else. Mere accusations mean nothing, don't take this seriously,\" ANI reports.\n3. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan\nScreengrab\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement has been the need of the hour since time immemorial and I hope together we keep the momentum going. At the same time, if a case gets sub judice, we have to respect the law of the land.\u201d\n4. Imran Khan\nTwitter\nSpeaking with Indian Express, the actor said, \u201cThese people might not come out in open, but I wanted to stand up and say I support them completely. I cannot be silent about it anymore. My conscience will not allow me to. As a man, I know what it is to say that.\u201d\n5. Parineeti Chopra and Arjun Kapoor\n\u201cWhat people are not understanding is, there are no rules that can be put in place. There is an unwritten rule: do not sexually harass people you are working with, or otherwise. What can we do to make it safe? Speak up when it happens, report it, take an action against that person. Keep eliminating as and when it comes.\n6. Chitrangada Singh\nTwitter/Chitrangda FC\nChitrangada said: \u201cThat was my stand to walk out of the film (Babumoshai Bandookbaaz) . I shared my reasons with a media house when they called me to talk about it. I believe that nobody gave importance to that matter that time. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because now media is doing an amazing job. #MeToo movement shouldn\u2019t be just about copying the West. It should be concerned about our society.\u201d\n7. Twinkle Khanna\nHearing stories,identifying in different ways has led to a churning within,long conversations,talking to my mom too about all the things we internalized as working women.Scabs picked at hurt again but it is worth it.A shout out to all the brave women making the world safer #MeToo \u2014 Twinkle Khanna (@mrsfunnybones) October 10, 2018\n8. Kangana Ranaut\n\"Whatever is happening with Vikas Bahl is absolutely correct. There are many people like Vikas Bahl he is not the only one. We still have a lot of work to do it so we should not start the celebrations as yet. We have a long way to go. We have to make this place [world] absolutely safe for woman.\"\n9. Anu Kapoor\n10. Renuka Shahane\n11. Emraan Hashmi\nIn an interview to Mumbai Mirror, \"In this scenario, this movement is a great start. It\u2019s our moral responsibility to protect women who have been at the receiving end for way too long but while most of the voices are speaking the truth, along with devious men, there are devious women with agendas too, who can use it against a man who has ticked them off in the past.\u201d\n12. Sonakshi Sinha\nIn a recent media interaction, Sonakshi said, \"Women should speak up when they have been wronged, of course, 100 percent, and the men who have wronged the women should be punished, 200 percent.\"\nHowever, the 'Lootera' actor added, \"I also feel that the facts and figures should be verified before the media talks about it or we talk about it.\"\n\"If it's in the hands of the law, I think the law should take its course but definitely women should speak up and the men who have committed such things should be punished.,\" she added.\n13. Mahesh Bhatt\nTwitter\n\u201cThe time has come for women to break barriers. Glad they are doing it. But I also want to remind them that they should not use this movement to settle scores,\u201d Mahesh Bhatt told Times Now.", "title": "Here's What Bollywood Stars Have To Say About The Ongoing #MeToo Movement In India", "date_publish": "11/10/2018, 18:24:46", "description": "The #MeToo movement gained momentum in India after Tanushree Dutta spoke up against Nana Patekar almost two weeks ago.
