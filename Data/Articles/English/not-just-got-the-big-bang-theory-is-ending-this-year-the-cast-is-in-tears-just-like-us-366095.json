As if Game Of Thrones wasn\u2019t enough, Suits and The Big Bang Theory is following suit!\nGoodbyes are always hard and imagine saying it to the team that has been together for 12 long years. The final table read that took place last night was as emotional as it can get. So much so that Kaley Cuoco aka Penny had a breakdown of sorts.\nDon't Miss 159 SHARES 842 SHARES\nFor the uninitiated, a final table read means that the entire cast and crew huddle together and read the script of the last episode of a season before the filming but in this case it was the series!\ntwitter\nIt was obvious that unlike the previous seasons which held a promise to meet again for the next one, this one was exceptionally difficult. This huddle was all about tears, sweet anecdotes, hugs and lots of tissues.
