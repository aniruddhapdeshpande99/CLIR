{"text": "Giving his two cents on #MeToo, Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn has said he was shocked by the #MeToo allegations against some of the prominent names in the Indian film industry but he believes a due course of law should be followed in such cases.\nTalking to PTI, he said,\nTwitter\n\"A couple of things came out and some people are like this but everybody is not like that. I would say some names did shock me but then I can\u2019t be judgmental completely till somebody proves someone guilty or not.\"\nKickstarted by Tanushree Dutta, several A-list Bollywood personalities including directors Rajkumar Hirani, Subhash Ghai, Sajid Khan, Vikas Bahl and Rajat Kapoor, actors Alok Nath, Nana Patekar, singer Kailash Kher and music composer Anu Malik were called out for sexually harassing women over the years.\nAFP\nAjay, who has supported the movement in the past, believes the power game does not work anymore in the industry. \u201cNew generation is thinking differently, they are not going to accept the bullshit what people used to accept couple of years back. They are changing and we are changing and that change is for better. With the media coming in, everything is out in the open. \u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018I am very powerful and you can\u2019t mess with me\u2019, you cannot mess with anybody as everybody is at the same platform, at the same stage. So big or small doesn\u2019t matter anymore, which is a good thing,\u201d he said.\nDon't Miss 862 SHARES 346 SHARES 183 SHARES\nEarlier, Ajay had told IANS,\nBCCL\n\u201cI would also like to mention that it is good that many stories are coming out (in the public), but one also has to understand that while most of the accounts are possibly real, some might have taken advantage of the gaining momentum. Therefore, investigation is needed. When people take advantage of the movement, it harms the purpose of the actual cause. Not all people are bad. But if we are only projecting one side, the next generation might get scared to step into the industry. That is why it is important to be responsible.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m disturbed by all the happenings with regards to #MeToo. My company and I believe in providing women with utmost respect and safety. If anyone has wronged even a single woman, neither ADF nor I will stand for it.\u201d he tweeted last year.\nI\u2019m disturbed by all the happenings with regards to #MeToo.

You never know it, no one is going to come up to you and say \u2018Hey, I did this!\u2019 I don\u2019t know how much of it is actually the truth or not. If it had happened in front of me, I\u2019m sure I would have stood up or done something about it. Never happened to me. I don\u2019t think it would have happened in front of me.\u201d\nOn the work front, the 49-year-old actor will be next seen in \u201cTotal Dhamaal\u201d that releases on February 22.
