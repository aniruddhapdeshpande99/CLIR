In the entire show, didn\u2019t you all crave to see him smiling, for once? While for a lot of people he was the greatest anti-hero in the world of television, for us, he defined a perfect man! Here\u2019s why!\n#1 If it wasn\u2019t for his family, he wouldn\u2019t have ever \u2018broken bad\u2019!\nvia GIPHY\nIf Walter White wasn\u2019t diagnosed with cancer, do you think he would have ever stepped in the world of drugs? He wouldn\u2019t have ever \u201cbroken bad\u201d. He was a family man. Whatever he did was for his family. Even in such circumstances, he risked everything so that he could leave behind money for his family; so that they could live their lives without any problems. He didn\u2019t choose meth life, meth life chose him.\n#2 The man is fearless!\nvia GIPHY\nHe was willing to cook meth even when he knew that would mean going to jail at the end of the day.\n#3 He was Mr. Perfectionist!\nvia GIPHY\nWhatever he did, he did it best \u2013 even if that means cooking up meth.

Jesse would have landed in jail in just days if Walter White wasn\u2019t with him.\nHe was doing it all for money, but to him quality mattered the most.

The man definitely had some guts.\n#5 He was honest in very many ways.\nvia GIPHY\nWe know what you\u2019re thinking. He lied to his wife Skyler. He kept his drug business a secret. But like they say, if you\u2019re lying for someone\u2019s benefit, you\u2019re not actually lying, right? He never lied. Not even to Hank. He clearly gave all the hints. After all, Hank never asked him directly if he was Heisenberg, maybe he would have told there and then. Don\u2019t you also feel Hank should have figured it out seasons ago? He was just hiding facts, not lying, right?\n#6 He is sexy and he knows it.\nvia GIPHY\nFrom a dorky science teacher to a rugged Drug Lord, Walter White was pretty damn attractive, don\u2019t you agree?
