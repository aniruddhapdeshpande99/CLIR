Hollywood actor Brad Pitt has joined Leonardo DiCaprio in for an upcoming Manson movie. The film is titled 'Once Upon A Time in Hollywood'.\nTwitter\nTarantino, who is writing and directing the film, has described the project as \u201ca story that takes place in Los Angeles in 1969, at the height of hippy Hollywood.\"\nAnd the new posters are giving the same vibe. Take a look.\nTwitter\nDiCaprio will play Rick Dalton, former star of a western TV series, while Pitt will be his longtime stunt double, Cliff Booth. \u201cBoth are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don\u2019t recognise anymore. But Rick has a very famous next-door neighbour...Sharon Tate,\u201d said Tarantino in an interview.\nDon't Miss 153 SHARES 862 SHARES 346 SHARES 183 SHARES 151 SHARES\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was 7 years old. I\u2019m very excited to tell this story of an LA and a Hollywood that don\u2019t exist anymore. And I couldn\u2019t be happier about the dynamic teaming of DiCaprio and Pitt as Rick and Cliff,\u201d he added.\nSome of the fans are not happy with the poster and are labelling it as photoshop. One person tweeted, \u201cRemember when REAL artist would paint real works of art for posters\u2026 Sigh, I mean I am still excited as hell for this movie but this poster is lame as f---!\u201d\nAnother social media user wrote, \u201cBrad Pitt looks photoshopped,\u201d while another chimed in saying the poster looked as though Pitt\u2019s face was fixed over Matthew McConaughey\u2019s body.\nTwitter\nBut there are many others like us who can't wait for the trailer to come out. Here are the tweets that will get you all excited for the release of this masterpiece.\nonce upon a time in hollywood (2019) coming for every single award pic.twitter.com/06dNyh7x2G \u2014 bauti (@loganmarshaII) March 18, 2019\nONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD is the first Tarantino I'll have seen since JACKIE BROWN where I didn't read the screenplay ahead of time.
