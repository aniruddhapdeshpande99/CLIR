The report further claims that Sansa Stark isn\u2019t quite pleased about brother Jon Snow kneeling before Daenarys Targaryen. Bryan Cogman has confirmed the same in a statement given to the portal.\n\u201cIt's about all of these disparate characters coming together to face a common enemy, dealing with their own past, and defining the person they want to be in the face of certain death. It's an incredibly emotional, haunting, bittersweet final season and I think it honours very much what [author George RR Martin] set out to do \u2013 which is flipping this kind of story on its head.\u201d\nBut how will the show come to an end? Who will die and who will survive? Who will sit on the Iron Throne finally?

Well, Kit Harington AKA Jon Snow said that he cried twice during the read-through for the script.\n\u201cThe second time was the very end. Every season, you read at the end of the last script 'End of Season 1' or 'End of Season 2'. This read 'End of Game of Thrones'. And you realise, OK, it's really happening.\u201d\nWell, he is not the only one, Sophie Turner who plays Sansa Stark on the show had also admitted that she burst into tears reading the last page of the script.\nScreengrab\n\u201cIt was very, very bittersweet\u2026 The first day of the actors coming in and that kind of production starting, the day where we had the final read through for the final script... it was really bittersweet. It was hard. t the end of the very last script, they read aloud, 'End of Game of Thrones'. As soon as they read that out, pretty much everyone burst into tears,\u201d she had said.", "title": "Game Of Thrones Season 8 Premiere Plot Has Been Disclosed & It\u2019s Not What You May Have Expected", "date_publish": "04/11/2018, 13:45:09", "description": "Game of Thrones season 8 plot details have been revealed.
