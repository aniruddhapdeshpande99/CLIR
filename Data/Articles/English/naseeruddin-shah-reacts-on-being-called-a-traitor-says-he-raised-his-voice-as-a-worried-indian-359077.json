Wondering why his comments on mob violence were being misconstrued with some people calling him a \"traitor\", actor Naseeruddin Shah said on Friday that he spoke as a \"worried Indian\" and has the right to express concerns about the country he loves.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\"What I said earlier was as a worried Indian. I have said this earlier as well. What did I say this time that I am being called a traitor? It is very strange,\" Shah told reporters here at his alma mater, St Anselm's Senior Secondary School.\nRaising his voice against the criticism he received, he asked,\nNaseeruddin Shah: What I said earlier was as a worried Indian. What did I say this time that I am being termed as a traitor? I am expressing concerns about the country I love, the country that is my home.

I am expressing concerns about the country I love, the country that is my home. How is that a crime?\"\nShah was responding to a question about the backlash he is receiving on social media following his remarks. The 68-year-old actor had expressed anxiety over the growing mob violence in a video interview with Karwan-e-Mohabbat India, which the organization shared on its YouTube channel on Monday. In the interview, the actor expressed concern over the well-being of his children, who he said have not been brought up as followers of any particular religion.\nThe internet was clearly divided.\nThose who constantly chant \"Hindu khatre mein hai\", are terming Naseeruddin Shah as a traitor for saying \"he's afraid for his children\". Apparently, only one group of people has the right to be concerned for themselves, baki sab anti-national. \u2014 Pratik Sinha (@free_thinker) December 21, 2018\nNaseeruddin Shah is right. There is indeed an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and intimidation... for traitors in today\u2019s India. This is new India. It no more entertains parasites who made their whole career here but feel more safe and loved in the enemy\u2019s territory. \u2014 Sonam Mahajan (@AsYouNotWish) December 21, 2018\nNaseeruddin Shah has been doing full-on identity politics himself, but when the other side gets down to identity politics, he smells fear and intolerance.\nHe doesn\u2019t think twice before tainting his own nation which has loved him so much, given him so much fame \u2014 Abhijit Majumder (@abhijitmajumder) December 21, 2018\nNews of no importance : 52 tribals enslaved for 3 years in Karnataka.\nNews of regional importance : 251 farmers suicides in Karnataka.\nNews of national importance : Taapsee Pannu ne troll pel diya.\nNews of international importance : Naseeruddin Shah ko darr lag raha hai. \u2014 THE SKIN DOCTOR (@theskindoctor13) December 21, 2018\nNaseeruddin Shah by speaking the truth has performed his duty to the nation. Our constitution, our ethos, our culture, our way of life are under attack.We will standup & protect it. Those who have a problem with this can go anywhere they like. India belongs to all of us.

Because they have no religion.\" Don't see anything wrong in what Naseeruddin Shah is saying. As a father, he can't be afraid for his children? \u2014 PDG (@PratimDGupta) December 21, 2018\nNaseeruddin Shah's fear as minority in India were misplaced as the ruling party had to deploy entire It cell and media channels to discredit him. It is the govt which is in fear. \u2014 Happucrat (@AreeDada__) December 21, 2018\nNaseeruddin Shah's fear as minority in India were misplaced as the ruling party had to deploy entire It cell and media channels to discredit him.

There is complete impunity for those who take law into their own hands. In many areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow is more significance than that of a police officer,\" he added.\nFor the uninitiated, on December 3, Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh and a student, Sumit Kumar, were killed in mob violence in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr district after cow carcasses were found strewn around.\nThe main accused in the case is a local Bajrang Dal leader, Yogesh Raj.\n(With PTI inputs)", "title": "Naseeruddin Shah Reacts On Being Called A Traitor, Says He Raised His Voice As A Worried Indian", "date_publish": "22/12/2018, 13:09:33", "description": "Naseeruddin Shah Wonders Why He's Being Called a Traitor, Says 'What I Said was as a Worried Indian' Naseeruddin Shah finds himself at the centre of a major controversy over his remarks on the spate of mob lynching cases in the country.
