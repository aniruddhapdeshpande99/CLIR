We also saw Suhana accompanying dad SRK on the sets of Zero.\nTwitter\nIn an interaction with the media, the superstar was asked about his daughter being on sets, to which he said,\nDon't Miss 5.1 K SHARES 153 SHARES 343 SHARES 2.4 K SHARES 555 SHARES\n\u201c She wants to act like I have said before but she needs to train for 3 to 4 years. She is doing some plays and theatre in London and now hopefully she will shift to America, she came on sets to learn how production works, as it is an important pat for an actor to learn. She was home so I told her to come along. I wanted her to see Anushka and Katrina\u2019s acting because both of them are different kind of actors, Katrina has her own charm while Anushka has her way of enacting things, so I wanted her to spend time with them, but instead they put her as my assistant director to get me from home on time. She was like papa the shot is ready.\u201d\nTwitter\nHe later added, \u201cI think ground experience is good for any actor. I want her to study acting for 3 to 4 years. In India, we don't learn acting we just assume we know acting. I want her to learn acting thoroughly\u201d.\nUndoubtedly, Suhana is the luckiest daughter.
