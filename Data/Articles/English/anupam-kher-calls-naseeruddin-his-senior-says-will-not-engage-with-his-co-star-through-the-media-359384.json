This was in reference to the comment Naseer made about the cop's death in Bulandshahr.\nKher and Shah have often sparred over their ideological differences.\nThe most recent instance was when Shah said in a video interview that a cow's death was being given more importance than that of a cop. \"There is freedom to say anything in the country so much so that you can abuse even the Army... How much more freedom do you want?\" Kher had said when asked to respond.\nOn Thursday, Kher was more circumspect and said Shah was a senior and \"respectable actor\".\nTalking to reporters at the trailer launch of his upcoming film \"The Accidental Prime Minister\", he said, \"He is my senior. It is his interpretation and he has the right. I love him.\"\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nBCCL\nKher also recalled an incident during the struggle days when he bought his first car and was noticed by Shah, his senior in NSD.\n\"For me, that moment is more important. As life goes by, you can disagree with one another's ideas. He is a respectable actor and my senior. If I have to say anything, I will pick up the phone or go to his house and say, \"Let's fight or hug it out'. I don't want to say anything through press,\" the actor said.\nInputs from PTI", "title": "Anupam Kher Calls Naseeruddin His Senior, Says Will Not Engage With His Co-Star Through The Media", "date_publish": "27/12/2018, 18:32:03", "description": "Asserting that disagreements happen as you go through life, actor Anupam Kher on Thursday said he will not engage with his senior and co-star Naseeruddin Shah through the media because they can always reach out to each other and \"hug it out\".
