The 59-year-old star of the House of Cards series, who has won two Oscars, is due to be formally charged on January 7 on the island of Nantucket with \"indecent assault and battery on a person over 14 years of age.\"\nIf found guilty, Spacey could face up to five years in jail. And now in a shocking update, the young man reportedly filmed part of the incident.\nAccording to court filings obtained by AFP, the young man, identified as William Little and aged 18 at the time of the alleged assault in July 2016, told police he had sent messages, including a video, to his girlfriend via the Snapchat app from the \"Club Car\" restaurant in Nantucket, where he was working as a bus boy for the summer.\nHe had remained in the bar after his shift had finished to see Spacey, of whom he was a fan. After meeting the actor and telling him he was 23 years old -- the legal drinking age is 21 in Massachusetts -- he started drinking first beer and then whiskey with Spacey.\nSpacey then allegedly invited him back to his place, along with some other friends. The young man declined, suspecting the actor was trying to seduce him. But he stayed in the bar in the hopes of getting a picture with Spacey.\nDon't Miss 106 SHARES\n\"Will only lingered around because he wanted a picture with Spacey, something for Instagram,\" the filing said. \"Spacey had told him, if you come back with me, I will take a picture with you.\"\nTwitter\nThat was when Spacey began sexually molesting the young man, the filed charges said.\n\"Will tried to shift away with his body and move Spacey's hands away with his hands but Spacey kept reaching down his pants,\" it said. \"Will said his girlfriend did not believe him so that's when he Snapchatted the video,\" it said.\nSpacey, who was forced out of public life by accusations of sexual misconduct in 2017, has not yet commented on the latest charges.\nBut this week he posted a video online of himself speaking about allegations of sexual abuse in the character of Frank Underwood, the scheming politician he played in House of Cards before the show dropped him.\nSpacey was considered one of the finest actors of his generation but his career nosedived following allegations of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen men in the United States and Britain.\nThe first public report of alleged abuse by him came from actor Anthony Rapp, who claimed that Spacey sexually abused him when Rapp was 14, in 1986.\nInputs from AFP", "title": "Man Who Accused Kevin Spacey Of Sexual Assault Reportedly Taped The Incident", "date_publish": "27/12/2018, 17:07:15", "description": "He had remained in the bar after his shift had finished to see Spacey, of whom he was a fan.
