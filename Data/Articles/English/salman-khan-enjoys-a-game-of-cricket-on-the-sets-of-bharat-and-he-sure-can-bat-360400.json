It is one of the most anticipated films of the year as it will bring together Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif for the sixth time.\nThe couple are a hit every time they appear on-screen. From Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya To Tiger Zinda Hai, the duo are pairing once again for the silver screen. Although this was not the original choice. Priyanka Chopra, who was initially cast opposite Salman Khan backed out of the project as the shooting clashed with her wedding with Nick Jonas.\nHowever, all's well that ends well. Directed by Ali Azaas Zafar, the film will hopefully release by the end of this year. Salman Khan is relentlessly working on the film day and night. But on days, when he's not shooting, he is still on the set, playing a fun game of cricket.\nDon't Miss 862 SHARES 346 SHARES 812 SHARES\nTake a look.\nWearing a striped t-shirt and a pair of denim shorts, Salman Khan looked adorable scoring sixes while batting. He posted the video on his Instagram and wrote, \"Bharat Khelega. #OnLocationStories.\"\nLooks like, after his hidden talent of being a painter, Salman is a fine cricketer too. He really is a jack of all trades and master of all too. (Yes, I am a Salman Khan fan and I cannot lie).\nBharat is slated to release around August 2018 where Salman will reportedly play the role of a circus artist.", "title": "Salman Khan Enjoys A Game Of Cricket On The Sets Of Bharat And He Sure Can Bat", "date_publish": "14/01/2019, 16:52:13", "description": "Salman Khan Enjoys A Game Of Cricket On The Sets Of Bharat And We Want To Play With Him TooSalman Khan Enjoys A Game Of Cricket On The Sets Of Bharat And We Want To Play With Him TooSalman Khan Enjoys A Game Of Cricket On The Sets Of Bharat And We Want To Play With Him TooSalman Khan Enjoys A Game Of Cricket On The Sets Of Bharat And We Want To Play With Him TooSalman Khan Enjoys A Game Of Cricket", "authors": ["Saloni Singh"], "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/salman-khan-enjoys-a-game-of-cricket-on-the-sets-of-bharat-and-he-sure-can-bat-360400.html\n", "image_url": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Jan/salman_1547465406_800x420.jpg"}
