{"text": "Kangana Ranaut and sister Rangoli Chandel are on a mission. From calling out nepotism to targeting Alia Bhatt and her family, things have been rough between the two families. While Alia has always given dignified responses, her mother Soni Razdan finally responded to the allegations in her own way.\nRazdan responded to allegations made by Kangana Ranaut\u2019s sister Rangoli Chandel, that she has no right to discuss Indian politics because she isn\u2019t a citizen of the country. However, she questioned Kangana\u2019s agenda and reminded Rangoli that it was Mahesh Bhatt who gave Kangana her big break in Bollywood.\nThese non Indians who are living off this land, using and abusing its people and its resources, lying about intolerance and spreading hatred, time to think about their agenda and not to get carried away with their provocations. https://t.co/FAwHChqopC \u2014 Rangoli Chandel (@Rangoli_A) April 14, 2019\nIn a tweet that has now been deleted, Soni Razdan had responded to Rangoli Chandel saying,\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 126 SHARES 336 SHARES 542 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES\n\u201cMahesh Bhatt is the man who has given her a break \u2026 she goes on to attack his wife and daughter.
