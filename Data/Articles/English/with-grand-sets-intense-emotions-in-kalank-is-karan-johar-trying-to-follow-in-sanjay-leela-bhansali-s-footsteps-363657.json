Sanjay Leela Bhansali's films are an extravagant visual feast. Adjectives would fall short to describe such larger than life movies. From Devdas to Bajirao Mastani, his movies are nothing short of poetic experiences. He has an impeccable eye for details. From palatial sets to elaborate costumes, he is a master of storytelling.\nOn the other hand, Karan Johar is known for masala entertainers. While his films always have a happy ending, SLB\u2019s movies end on a sad note. KJo is known for his multi-starrer movies. He once even said that he fears what if his films stop working, and so he chooses to rope in many stars. Perhaps, he thinks the star-power works.\nTOI\nWhen the teaser of his upcoming movie \u2013 again a multi-starrer \u2013 was released, it had everything but the Karan Johar feels. Is Karan Johar trying to break into the grandeur and charm of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, everyone is asking.\nDon't Miss 544 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\n#1\n#2\n#3\n#4\n#5\nWatch the teaser and decide for yourself.\nAnd after watching the teaser, everyone has the same question.\nAre you sure it's not a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie?#KalankTeaserhttps://t.co/9nCD4d87eU \u2014 Shubham Verma (@ashubhguy) March 12, 2019\n#Kalank looks like a sanjay leela bhansali style movie!
