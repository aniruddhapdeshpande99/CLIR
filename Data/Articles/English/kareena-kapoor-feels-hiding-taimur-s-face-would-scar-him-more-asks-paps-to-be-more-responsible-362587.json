{"text": "Star kids stay in the limelight all the time but the attention that Taimur Ali Khan hogs, it's bizarre and different. From clicking him at the playground to taking his airport shots, it was revealed that Taimur's pictures are in high demand and photographers get paid a bomb for them.\nTaimur Ali Khan is already a household name thanks to the constant media attention on the two-year-old but mother Kareena Kapoor Khan says the scrutiny is sometimes too much.\nTwitter\nThe actor said while she and husband Saif Ali Khan don\u2019t believe in stopping the paparazzi from clicking pictures of their son, the media should be a little more responsible. When asked how does she look at the massive popularity of Taimur, Kareena told PTI,\nAgencies\nDon't Miss 707 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES\n\u201cWe view it as something socially irresponsible because we have been such good parents, we haven\u2019t shied away, we never hid Taimur\u2019s face. In Hollywood, they don\u2019t allow children\u2019s faces to come (publish). But because Saif and I took the modern approach, we can\u2019t do that.\u201d\nThe 38-year-old actor said both Saif and her don\u2019t want to to cover Taimur\u2019s face when they are out as it will \u201cprobably scar him more.\u201d \u201cHe would think \u2018what is happening?\u2019 I don\u2019t want him to grow up in that fear. I want him to grow up and fly, that\u2019s what parents want their children to do. I can\u2019t keep him away.\u201d\nHowever, Kareena added that media should handle it all with a \u201clittle bit more responsibility\u201d should be there because he is a child.\nInstagram\n\u201cThat would be nice from the media. I have never stopped them. But the constant attention, scrutiny (isn\u2019t good). Hopefully he\u2019s going to be a cool kid like his parents, be more interested in music and sports. That\u2019s what we want.\"\nKareena said she has become a lot more responsible after becoming a mother and feels her life now revolves around Taimur.\nInstagram\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for mothers to have the knowledge of vaccination, they have to get the child immunised. It\u2019s important for mothers to have more knowledge because for a newborn infant, they are taking that responsibility. \u201cThat\u2019s why my life is in Taimur\u2019s hands because everything\u2019s about him. I hope people understand that and take it in a positive way,\u201d she added.\n(With agency inputs)", "title": "Kareena Kapoor Feels Hiding Taimur's Face Would Scar Him More, Asks Paps To Be More Responsible", "date_publish": "22/02/2019, 12:27:35", "description": "Kareena Kapoor says that while she and Saif Ali Khan have decided not to hide son Taimur from media, the photographer should also act responsibly around him.
