Thanking Modi in a post, here\u2019s what Karan Johar wrote:\n\u201cPowerful and timely conversations can bring about change and this was one of what we hope will become a regular conversation. Meeting the Honorable Prime Minister @narendramodi today was an incredible opportunity.\nAs a community, there is a huge interest to contribute to nation building. There is so much that we want to do. And can do and this dialogue was towards how and what ways we can do that. When the youngest country (in demography) joins hands with the largest movie industry in the world, we hope to be a force to reckon with. Together we would love to inspire and ignite positive changes to a transformative India.\nThe film industry would also like to send a huge thanks for the GST reduction in movie ticket prices that was implemented recently!\nThank you so much for your time, Sir!\u201d", "title": "PM Modi\u2019s Selfie With The Young Bollywood Brigade Gets Trolled, People Call Them \u2018A Bunch Of Cowards\u2019", "date_publish": "11/01/2019, 10:59:11", "description": "Hailed as notable young icons of the Hindi film industry, Bollywood biggies including Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana, Bhumi Pednekar, Karan Johar, Rohit Shetty, Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra landed in Delhi yesterday to meet the prime minister of the nation Narendra Modi.", "authors": ["Garima Satija"], "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/pm-modi-s-selfie-with-the-young-bollywood-brigade-gets-trolled-people-call-them-a-bunch-of-cowards-360208.html\n", "image_url": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Jan/pm_modis_selfie_with_young_bollywood_icons_gets_trolled_people_call_them_a_bunch_of_cowards_1547186360_800x420.png"}
