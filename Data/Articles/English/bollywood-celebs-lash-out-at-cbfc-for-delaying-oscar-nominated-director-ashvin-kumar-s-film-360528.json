{"text": "For the uninitiated, Ashvin Kumar is Bollywood\u2019s youngest Oscar-nominated and two times national award winning director. He was nominated at the Academy Awards for his shot film titled Little Terrorist in 2004. However, for his next film titled No Fathers In Kashmir, which is a coming-of-age love story revolving around two teenagers who lost their father after they were picked up by the armed forces, he is facing the wrath of the censor board.\nTwitter\nNo Fathers In Kashmir had earlier been denied a U certificate. Ashvin Kumar said that movie didn\u2019t have any nude or vulgar scenes, and hence, he took his fight forward to FCAT and appealed against the fact it got an A certificate. However, he is juggling between the demands of the two bodies, which are reportedly ordering fresh cuts.\nTwitter\nAmid all this, Bollywood celebs including Swara Bhaskar and Soni Razdan, who is also a part of the film, lashed out at CBFC.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nThe film 'No Fathers in Kashmir' - Directed by Academy Award Nominee & two time National Award Winner #AshvinKumar - has been stuck with the Censor Board for over 6months now, delaying its release.

Unconscionable! \u2014 Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) January 10, 2019\nAshvin @ashvinkumar knows Kashmir so well. That\u2019s the first thing I thought when I read this script. And that\u2019s exactly why I so wanted to be a part of this project. For once I felt that here is a film that doesn\u2019t pretend ... doesn\u2019t mislead ... and most importantly doesn\u2019t lie. pic.twitter.com/nYeIOMIFXg \u2014 Soni Razdan (@Soni_Razdan) January 16, 2019\n2/3 It does so gently, with a lot of ironies, with tongue in cheek humour and a wonderful story full of courageous, innocent and sometimes foolish characters.
