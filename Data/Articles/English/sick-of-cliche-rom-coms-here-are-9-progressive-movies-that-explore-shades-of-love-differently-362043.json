{"text": "What is love? Most of us derive the definition of love from movies. Oodles of clich\u00e9d masala, sprinkles of Raj, butterflies in the stomach, secret glances, the glint in the eyes, tumultuous life turning into a cakewalk \u2013 love is a feeling out of this world!\nvia GIPHY\nBut does that happen in real life? To break your bubble \u2013 Raj is a myth, Rahul would be quite annoying in real-life, best friends usually don\u2019t give a shit about your personal life, poor guys never turn rich in an instant, the geek usually remains a geek and also he doesn\u2019t get the chick, road trips are mesmerising but not hassle-free, club isn\u2019t the place to find love anymore, and weddings are full of anxiety and never excitement \u2013 these expectations derived from reel-life have ruined our real lives!\nvia GIPHY\nSo, what is love? Is there even a definition? It is one of the most profound emotions that are difficult to put into words. And each love story is different. Yes, it is.\nLove is a strange feeling and it has different definitions for different people. Love has no boundaries, no limits. It knows no age or barriers.\nWith time Bollywood is learning that. Here are some of the movies that showed different shades of love!\n#1 The updated version of love -- Manmarziyaan\n\u201cKala na safed hai\u2026 Ishqe da rang yara\u2026 Grey walaa shade\u2026 Zamana hai badla\u2026 Mohabbat bhi badli\u2026 Ghise pitey version nu\u2026 Maaro update\u201d\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nTwitter\nHave you ever been in love with someone who helps you find yourself but also kills a part of you? Manmarziyaan showed us the violent side of love. The Anurag Kashyap directorial explored the feeling called love beautifully giving it a refreshing colour. Three lost souls rediscover themselves while dismantling the romanticism of eternal love.\n#2 Love flows free -- Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga\n\u201cAnkhiyan de kol reh jaane de\u2026 Kehna hai jo keh jaane de... Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga\u201d\nTwitter\nRajkummar Rao and Sonam Kapoor starrer love story Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga is a complete fairytale romantic film but with a twist.

It talks about a subject that has never been talked about before \u2013 sex life of parents. What happens when a man (played by Ayushmann Khurrana) finds out that his mother is pregnant. This movie was a game-changer especially for Indian audiences, for whom the idea of their parents having sexual desires is somewhat alien. Parents make love too \u2013 this film helped in normalising such discussions.\n#5 The unusual love story \u2013 October\ncinestaan.com\nOctober isn\u2019t a story about love at first sight. It\u2019s not about kisses and hugs and promises. It\u2019s an unusual love story about selfless love. This thought-provoking story revolves around interns who are going through the usual grind but suddenly an accident changes their lives forever. Danish and Shuili haven\u2019t shared a great camaraderie before but after she goes into coma, he leaves no stone unturned to help her. But why? Maybe because of love \u2013 not a conventional one for sure. The movie leaves behind so many open-ended questions.\n#6 Modern day interpretation of Heer Raanjha -- Raanjhana\nTwitter\nNot a fairytale romance, Raanjhana is an epic modern day romantic movie that has reinterpreted the romance of Heer and Raanjha in modern-day context. Love doesn\u2019t always come easy. Sometimes it's one-sided too. A man sacrifices his life for a girl who never reciprocated the feeling he had for her.

The movie reveals how sometimes things or some people can only find a place in your heart and not in life. You have to accept that and move on. Just like hate, love can be a baggage too.\n#9 The innocence of arranged love \u2013 Dum Laga Ke Haisha\nTwitter\nWe are all acquainted with the concept of arranged marriage, right? Sometimes it\u2019s a mismatch. In Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar starrer Dum Laga Ke Haisha, the husband and wife, who are not in love, are trying to cope up with their inadequacies, but eventually, land up in the court to get divorced.
