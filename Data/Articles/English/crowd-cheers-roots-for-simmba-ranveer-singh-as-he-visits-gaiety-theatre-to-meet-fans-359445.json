Not too many people understand how painstaking it is to make masala films. Not enough credit is given to the makers of the genre. I think come Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I will definitely be there in single screen theatres like Chandan, Gaiety-Galaxy, celebrating because there is no greater trip when you watch with the live audience and Simmba is that film.\nEven during Padmaavat I would sneak into theatres and watch the film with the audience and I would be amazed to see them cheering for Khilji, the villain. I live for it. All things aside, I will have that experience.\nWhen you are in the hall and when you see the audience clapping, whistling, dancing in the aisles, roaring with laughter, going up on the screen and dancing, I am that audience, I have done it time and again. I did it in Paris for Salman Khan's Sultan. I am 100 per cent going to do it.\"\nDon't Miss 185 SHARES 544 SHARES 411 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES\nRanveer being Ranveer always sticks to his words and today, on a Friday, he and film's director Rohit Shetty arrived at Gaiety Galaxy, Bandra to meet the crowd.\nApart from addressing his fans, Singh also danced to 'Aankh Maare' which is a chart-buster number from the film.
