Well, the change we wanted to see is finally here.\nThe trailer of Sonam Kapoor-Anil Kapoor-Rajkummar Rao-Juhi Chawla starrer 'Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laha' was out yesterday and people are overwhelmed.\nIn a first, we will see a family drama that will revolve around the topic that many filmmakers are scared of even touching.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nThe trailer showcases Sonam Kapoor as a typical Indian girl who dreams of \u201chappily ever after\u201d.\nHowever, after many twists and turns in her arranged marriage proposals, she finally is seen talking about her 'secret' that she is afraid of sharing.\nAs soon as the trailer was out, people started raving the team for touching the topic. The team was applauded and especially Sonam Kapoor, who has become one of the first few actresses who chose to experiment and take up a subject that many mainstream actors would have not taken up.\nVVC Films\nHere is how the Internet celebrated the trailer of ELKDTAL.
