I want to take care of my family and my ailing mother instead of roaming here and there to get justice for whatever has happened to me.\u201d\nShe went on to explain how #MeToo movement has failed to work in a country like India, where victims are intimated and mocked. She said,\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\n\u201cPeople are really making fun of the entire #MeToo campaign. Nothing has happened, nobody has been arrested. If cops are only busy registering FIRs, then what is the use of this entire campaign? Tell me, how many people have been arrested? Cops asked me if I wanted to register an FIR, but I don\u2019t see any reason for moving ahead to get justice as whatever I had to say is in the public domain. We (Ghai and her) were very good friends, but he destroyed everything; I\u2019ve said this publicly and I\u2019m saying it again. I am fed up of everything, hence I have withdrawn my case.\u201d", "title": "Citing How #MeToo Movement Failed, Kate Sharma Withdraws Harassment Case Against Subhash Ghai", "date_publish": "24/11/2018, 15:46:28", "description": "She further said, \u201cPeople are really making fun of the entire #MeToo campaign.
