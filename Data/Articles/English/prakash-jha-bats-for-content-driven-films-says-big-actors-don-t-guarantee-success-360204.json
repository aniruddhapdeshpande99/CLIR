{"text": "Prakash Jha is one of the most eminent directors we have in the Hindi film industry today. He loves to make films based on politics and the corruption surrounding it. But he begs to differ; the ace filmmaker says he never makes a film on the line of politics or corruption but on the situation and a character which he gets connected to.\nTwitter\nIn an exclusive conversation with Indiatimes, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t make a film on any situation; I find a story in that situation. I don\u2019t think that I am going to make a film on today\u2019s politics. If there will be some story or struggle of any individual and I get connected to it, and if his order character is connected to politics, then I will show that in the film. Otherwise, I don\u2019t make films on politics precisely.\u201d\nTwitter\nTalking about if corruption is his favorite subject on film making, he said,\n\u201cThere has been corruption in politics every time. Forget today, there was corruption in Mahabharata, which we worship today. There are so many corrupt people in Mahabharata. How women were treated, so, we have been like this always, so I will not make a film on it, I will find a character, like Draupadi or Arjun\u2019s character. I will enhance their characters surrounding the basis of corruption and their journey\u201d.\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nWe all know how Prakash Jha was one of the first few directors who started the trend of cop drama with Gangajal. Today every filmmaker is enchasing a similar concept, to which he said, \"I only think of a story while making a film and nothing else, that I am going to set a trend with this or that film. I think if my story or the character will be accepted by the audiences or not, will they get engaged with my storytelling, that\u2019s my only focus. I made Jai Gangajal, where there were no issues shown of Bihar, the story was about a land, corporate and colonization issue and the inherent corruption about politics and police.\u201d\nTwitter\n2018 was a landmark year of films. While the movie featuring Khans flopped, content driven films became instant hits. Prakash Jha has also always focussed on creative topical subjects. Speaking about the same, he said,\n\"It has to happen, good film and good content have to work, today there is an exhibition possible for small budget films due to multiplexes. Audiences get to choose the film, they read the reviews, watch the trailer and then decide which film to watch, it\u2019s not like Khans films will have to work or won\u2019t work.\nIf the content of the film is good, it will work otherwise not, it\u2019s that simple and it has been proved time and again. It\u2019s a very good time; we are the creators of content and extremely happy to see this phase.\u201d He further added, \u201cThe film will definitely be still sold on the name of big actors even today but it\u2019s not important the audiences will come and watch it.\u201d\nTwitter\nPrakash Jha is now coming with a film that is the complete opposite to the genres he's attempted in the past which is - comedy. Yes! The director is producing Fraud Saiyaan featuring Arshad Warsi in the lead.\nTwitter\nTalking about producing Fraud Saiyyan, he said, \u201cI invested my money in this film because I thought it\u2019s an enjoyable film, When I was reading the script, I was totally engaged, there is no serious subject in it, but I constantly laughed while reading it.\"", "title": "Prakash Jha Talks About Corruption, Khans And The Future Of Content Driven Films", "date_publish": "11/01/2019, 19:23:01", "description": "Prakash Jha is one of the eminent directors in the Hindi film industry.
