Back then, little did we - my band of rockstars and I -- know how far from the village our film would take us. From Toronto to Paris, Cairo to Los Angeles and even all the way back home, the love which greeted us in every town, at every screening, was beyond any of our wildest dreams. Without that love - all its warmth and generosity - we could not have made it as far as we have. So thank you. Thank you for opening your hearts to our film. For allowing it to enter you, live with you, breathe with you. Our journey towards the Oscars might end today, but it has been an incredible journey full of hopes and aspirations. Thank you for being there every step of the way.\"\nShe ended the note saying: \"We will keep our faith alive to keep dreaming.\" Village Rockstars is set in Das' own village of Chhaygaon in Assam.\nRead her post here:\nThe film follows Dhunu, a girl who grows up in poverty and learns to fend for herself.
