We fear it so much that we\u2019d rather not talk about it... which is why it\u2019s important to have a day where we pull out the band aid and help us deal with this disease.\u201d\nShe added that she battled her fear and decided to fight back. She added,\n\u201cI was scared too, but soon realised that burying my head in the sand was not the way to deal with this. And so... with the little experience I have had, I urge you all to take the time to understand it. There\u2019s more to cancer than being emotional or weak or even being called a fighter or a survivor. It requires you to study it, find out what works for you and to be diligent about your treatment. It requires days of strongly believing in oneself, of knowing that tomorrow will be better than today. It is not a fight against negative thoughts. It\u2019s taking a stand to not give in, no matter what. Most importantly, it is about living every day, and not just surviving.\u201d", "title": "On World Cancer Day, Sonali Bendre Pens Down A Note On How To Stay Positive Amidst The Battle", "date_publish": "04/02/2019, 17:23:21", "description": "Be it the beginning of her chemotherapy, losing her hair or the pain of staying away from her loved ones, her journey broke our hearts but sewed the pieces back perfectly-thanks to her positivity to see the silver lining.
