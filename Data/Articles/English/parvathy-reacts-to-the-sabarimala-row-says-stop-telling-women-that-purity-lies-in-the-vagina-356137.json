{"text": "The Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all age groups entry into the Sabarimala temple managed to create divided opinions among people. Giving her piece of mind on the same is Malayalam film actor Parvathy Thiruvothu, who has come out in support of the Supreme Court verdict.\nTwitter\nIn an interview with CNN News-18, Parvathy for the first time bared her heart out. Talking about her opinion on the same, Parvathy said,\n\"I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of flak for this, I'm definitely with the verdict. But then when you really strip down the religion and the patriarchy ingrained in religion, you have to peel a lot of layers before you even get to a logical conversation with these women. With regard to the film industry, fighting women is way more difficult than fighting with men. We have senior actresses who have also gone through assault who are like 'why are you creating a ruckus? Can\u2019t we all just get along?\u2019 I could not believe that you are hearing it from actresses whom you look up to, who have been here for years and years, and who have gone through the abuse. One can\u2019t understand why they are alright with the muzzling, keeping quiet. It's a very grey space to be in.\"\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES\nShe went on to explain how purity and vagina has no co-relation and people need to stop commenting on the same. She added,\n\"I think definitely, this is coming from a space of being okay and also not creating issues. Everyone wants to get along, have peace of mind and also believe sometimes that women are impure when they menstruate. It's been ingrained in me since the time I was born. I can see that in every woman. You are about your body, your purity lies in your vagina or your virginity, for that matter. That needs to be taken away and for that I don't know how many years or generations it's going to take, but our voice has to be sustained. I'm scared that it will get muzzled soon if we don't keep it up.\"", "title": "Parvathy Reacts To The Sabarimala Row, Says Stop Telling Women That Purity Lies In The Vagina", "date_publish": "06/11/2018, 11:56:22", "description": "The Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all age groups entry into the Sabarimala temple managed to create divided opinions among people.
