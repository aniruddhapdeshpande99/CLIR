Kaha se aate hain? \u2013 This dialogue from Jolly LLB still tickles our funny bone, doesn\u2019t it? The creative minds on the internet still use this as a meme template.\nArshad Warsi\u2019s Jolly LLB was indeed a great satirical take on the judicial system of India. Who would have thought that this movie, having no (conventional) big star, would win so many accolades including a National Award for the best feature film!\nTwitter\nAfter a grand success, when the makers decided to make a sequel of the movie, they ditched Arshad Warsi and replaced him with Akshay Kumar. Of course, the man was disappointed.\n\u201cI am not doing it (Jolly LLB 2). Akshay is doing it. I was supposed to do it, but Fox Star Studios needed a bigger star, so they chose Akshay,\u201d he had told IANS.\ndnaindia.com\nHowever, when the trailer was released, Arshad Warsi showed a big heart and congratulated the team.\nFinally saw the trailer of Jolly LLB2. Love the new Jolly. Looking forward to it, all the best to @humasqureshi @akshaykumar & @subkapoor \u2014 Arshad Warsi (@ArshadWarsi) December 20, 2016\nDon't Miss 1.1 K SHARES 814 SHARES 446 SHARES 494 SHARES 1.7 K SHARES\nJolly LLB 2 was a blockbuster too. But was that because of Akshay Kumar? Well, Arshad Warsi believes that the movie would have still been a hit, if the makers had roped him in along with Boman Irani.\n\u201cI think, let's be honest, if Boman and me were there in Jolly LLB 2, it would've still done a 100 crore. And they would've still made more money because they would not be paying us as much as they paid Akshay (laughs). It was a bad move, actually. So, bad move. Actually, Fox (producers) would've made more money with Boman and me (laughs),\u201d he was quoted as saying by ZoomTV.\nTwitter\nTalking about Jolly LLB 3, he said that it will star both Akshay Kumar and him. \u201cThat's what I heard. That's what I've been told.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all well that ends well, right? Meanwhile, Arshad Warsi will next be seen in Fraud Saiyaan, which is scheduled to hit the screens on January 18.", "title": "Arshad Warsi Feels Jolly LLB 2 Would\u2019ve Still Been A Hit Had He Starred In It Instead Of Akshay Kumar", "date_publish": "12/01/2019, 12:45:32", "description": "Jolly LLB 2 was a blockbuster too.
