Actually, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m surviving on, but I\u2019m surviving\u201d.\nIt won\u2019t be wrong to say that he works very hard for his films and that handwork reflects on his work and so he has earned this massive fan following.\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 812 SHARES 468 SHARES 343 SHARES 3 K SHARES 555 SHARES\nSalman not only called himself a mediocre talent but also praised his contemporaries and friends Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, he said, \u201cIt is not as if Aamir or Shah Rukh are choosing bad or worse films. There are times when the movies I\u2019ve chosen, to the best of my knowledge, haven\u2019t worked. And then one film works and you\u2019re back. SRK is a legend, as is Aamir. A bad movie here or there may happen, but they will always come back.\u201d\nWe are all aware of SRK's recent career graph, from Dilwale to Zero, the box office collections have not been impressive enough but King Khan hasn't lost hope and his friend Salmna Khan too.\nTwitter\nTalking about his failure especially Tubelight, Salman said, \u201cWe thought that Tubelight (same combination of Kabir Khan and me) will be a beautiful film, after our much-appreciated super hit, Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015).
