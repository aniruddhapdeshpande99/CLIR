And if not all the seven seasons, at least re-watch the first one, says Maisie Williams AKA Arya Stark.\nfanpop.com\nIn order to be ready for the Game of Thrones season 8, Maisie Williams says the first season plays a huge role in what happens in the Game of Thrones season 8. In fact, she herself did the same after having read the script of the finale season, she said.\nmymodernmet.com\n\u201cAfter reading the scripts I went back and watched season one again because so much of it refers back to that season. There are so many scenes that will look similar. And also I watched just to remind myself of the arc I've taken already. I wanted Arya to go full circle and try for some kind of normalcy like when she was younger,\u201d she was quoted as saying to Entertainment Weekly.\nIf you remember the first season, it was quite slow and brooding, right? That is perhaps because there was a lot of set-up that will all make sense in Game of Thrones season 8.\nDon't Miss 596 SHARES 246 SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 406 SHARES\nvia GIPHY\nFurthermore, talking about season 8 and her character, here\u2019s what she said:\n\u201cThis year it's like she has a dual personality there are so many emotions and memories that come flooding back when you're with your family and the things that you fight for becoming very different, yet she's also remaining on this path to try and kill Cersei and remembering her list and getting closer to that. So there's this split with Arya between trying to be who she wants to be getting back to the naivete and innocence with her family and unfinished business.\u201d\nvia GIPHY\nThe cast and the crew of the show have hinted in the past that the show will have a \u201cbitter-sweet ending\u201d and that not everyone will be happy with it.
