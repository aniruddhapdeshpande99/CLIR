They rationalized saying how audiences are very emotional, they even draw lines between actors and stars. If they love a character, they will shower the love on who played the character and if they hate the character, that hate will come upon the actor.\"\nBut we're glad the 33-year-old thought otherwise.\nTwitter\n\"I trusted the audience, I trusted their maturity and the fact that they have evolved over time that they can see the performance for what it is. I felt that if I do this part well, they will appreciate me as an actor. I'm glad I trusted the audience and my trust in them paid off. It was a huge risk, but I'm never one to play it safe. So I'm glad I took the risk,\" he concluded.\n(Inputs from IANS)", "title": "Ranveer Singh Knew The Audience Will Appreciate Him, If He Played The Alauddin Khilji Part Well", "date_publish": "12/12/2018, 12:30:25", "description": "The beginning of the year saw his mega release Padmaavat where for the first time in a long time, we saw an A-lister hero play the role of a villain.The beginning of the year saw his mega release Padmaavat where for the first time in a long time, we saw an A-lister hero play the role of a villain.The beginning of the year saw his mega release Padmaavat where for the first time in a long time.", "authors": ["Saloni Singh"], "url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/entertainment/celebs/ranveer-singh-knew-the-audience-will-appreciate-him-if-he-played-the-alauddin-khilji-part-well-358408.html\n", "image_url": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2018/Dec/ranveer_1544603594_800x420.jpg"}
