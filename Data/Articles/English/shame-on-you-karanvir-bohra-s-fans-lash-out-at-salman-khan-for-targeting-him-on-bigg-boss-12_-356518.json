Karanvir Bohra\u2019s Fans Lash Out At Salman Khan For Targeting Him On Bigg Boss 12\n\u201cWhat has Karanvir Bohra done to deserve such humiliation?\u201d Since the starting of the season, fans have always felt that Salman Khan has been targeting TV actor Karanvir Bohra on Bigg Boss 12.

From Deepak Thakur, Romil, Surbhi to Dipika Kakkar, he slammed everyone for their behaviour and performance in tasks, including Karanvir Bohra.\nSalman Khan was seen calling out Dipika Kakkar for being biased towards Karanvir Bohra during the captaincy task, and that didn\u2019t go down well with the TV actor\u2019s fans. Adding to that, Salman also mocked his fashion sense yet again leaving the fans furious.\nDon't Miss 812 SHARES 520 SHARES 3 K SHARES 2.3 K SHARES\n#1\n@BeingSalmanKhan Stop humiliating #KVB for no reason at all just to embarrass and mock him.
