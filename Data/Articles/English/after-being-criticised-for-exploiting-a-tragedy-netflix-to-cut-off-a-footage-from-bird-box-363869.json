But Netflix said at the time it wasn\u2019t planning to cut the clip, although said it was looking at ways to do things differently moving forward.\nNexflix changed its mind and said Friday it will replace the footage with an outtake from a former TV series in the U.S. The company said it is \u201csorry for any pain caused to the Lac-Megantic community.\u201d\nnetflix\nDon't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES\nThe mayor of Lac-Megantic, Julie Morin, had criticized the use of the footage, calling it \u201ca lack of respect.\u201d She and Quebec\u2019s culture and communications minister, Nathalie Roy, applauded Netflix\u2019s latest move. \u201cThis result shows that by being united and pooling our efforts, everything is possible,\u201d Roy tweeted.\nInputs From AP", "title": "After Being Criticised For Exploiting A Tragedy, Netflix To Cut Off A Footage From Bird Box", "date_publish": "17/03/2019, 17:52:11", "description": "Netflix Will Cut Bird Box Footage Months After Outcry: Months after its official release, Netflix has decided to remove footage of a real train disaster from its post-apocalyptic survival film \"Bird Box\".
