In his statement, he mentioned how he had proposed the idea of taking the matter to &quot;committee or a legal body&quot; but the complainant chose to go the media instead.
A statement issued by Hirani in media reads:
&quot;I was completely shocked when these allegations were brought to my notice about two months back. I had suggested immediately that it is essential to take this matter to any committee or any legal body. The complainant has chosen to go to the media instead. I want to very strongly state that this is a false malicious and mischievous story being spread with the sole intention of destroying my reputation.&quot;
Just to join the dots for you, a HuffPost India article reported that a woman (Who was assisting Hirani on Sanju) said that on April 9, 2018, the director first passed a sexually suggestive remark to her and later sexually assaulted her at his home office.

&quot;I remember forming these words on my lips - 'Sir, This is wrong. Because of this power structure. You being the absolute power and me being a mere assistant, a nobody - I will never be able to express myself to you',&quot; she wrote of the April 9 incident in the email to Chopra, as quoted by HuffPost India.
The woman added that Hirani was a father figure for her.
