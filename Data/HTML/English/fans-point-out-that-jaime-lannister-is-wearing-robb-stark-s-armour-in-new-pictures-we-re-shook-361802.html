The pictures gave a glimpse of all the characters of the show, and curious fans found something weird in that too. In Jaime Lannister’s pictures, ardent Game of Thrones fans noticed the similarity of his armour with that of Robb Stark’s armour. Robb Stark had died in season 3, so what does this hint?
Fans couldn’t stop speculating.
Is it just me or is Jaime's armour very reminiscent of Robb Starks, particularly the breastplate & pauldrons. And I like how he's no longer in lavish Lannister armour, he's dressed for a real, gritty battle and I'm loving it! #GameOfThrones pic.twitter.com/hdfBWlj0mT — chillyravenart (@chillyravenart) February 6, 2019
He's another 'dishonoured' knight, (like Jorah & the Hound) who's been given a chance at redemption & to fight for the living. And if he has to die, I hope he goes out gloriously, I hope singers sing about him for a thousand years to come 💔 pic.twitter.com/gZFSgOxMj5 — chillyravenart (@chillyravenart) February 7, 2019
