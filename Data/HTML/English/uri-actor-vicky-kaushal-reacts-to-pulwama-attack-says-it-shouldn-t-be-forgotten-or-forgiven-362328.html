The actor made the remarks on the sidelines of the final day of Act Fest, organised by Cine and TV Artistes' Association (CINTAA) and the 48 Hour Film Project. Actress Kubra Sait also condemned the attack and urged people to be kind towards humanity. Sait said,
&quot;The film fraternity is coming together to say that what happened is incorrect... it is extremely heartbreaking and shocking. I will not support terrorism in any way especially when terrorism is faked in the mask of faith. I'm not somebody who agrees to this. I think its high time that humans started loving each other with kindness with respect and just with love.&quot;
