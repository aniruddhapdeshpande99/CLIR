Ayan Mukerji Shares A Heartfelt Note On Why He Is Pushing The Release Of 'Brahmastra' To 2020!
For all Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt fans who were eagerly waiting for the release of their first film together, there's a sad news!
Ayan Mukerji on Saturday announced that he has decided to postpone the release of his passion project &quot;Brahmastra&quot; as he did not want to compromise on the technical aspects of the film.
The movie, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, was earlier set to release in December this year, but now the makers have pushed it to summer 2020. &quot;'Brahmastra' is a dream that began for me in 2011...That dream is about creating a movie that offers our country something that's really... new and amazing and next level..in terms of story, characters and emotion, always... but also in terms of visual and visual effects.
&quot;... In the past week, I have learnt that all the teams working on the movie, led by my VFX teams, need more time in order to get the VFX right, to get the sound and music right, and eventually to get the film right,&quot; Ayan said in a statement posted on his social media accounts.

The director said, with &quot;Brahmastra&quot;, he is working towards creating the best possible movie experience for the audience.
&quot;I believe that the extra time going into making the movie is essential to achieve the dream of 'Brahmastra', and I really hope that we make up for the delay by giving our movie-loving country something they can really love and feel proud of... Back to film work then. So much to do,&quot; he said.
The film, produced by Karan Johar's Dharma Productions, also features megastar Amitabh Bachchan in a pivotal role.
