&ldquo;All this is being concertedly eroded by the current government. The BJP, which came to power five years ago with the promise of development, has given free rein to Hindutva goons to indulge in the politics of hate and violence,&rdquo; reads the joint statement.

In the same regard, Anupam Kher, who was last seen in The Accidental Prime Minister, said that these people from the film fraternity are &ldquo;officially campaigning&rdquo; for opposition parties by releasing that letter for public.
So some people from my fraternity have issued a letter for public to vote out the present constitutionally elected government in the coming elections. In other words they are officially campaigning for opposition parties. Good!! At least there are no pretensions here. Great. 🙏 pic.twitter.com/gqnZBGNdKa — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPKher) April 6, 2019

Anupam Kher’s tweet didn’t go down well with people, including actors such as Swara Bhasker and Soni Razdan. Hitting back at Anupam Kher, Swara Bhasker wrote, &ldquo;Yes, it's called democracy sir&rdquo;. To which Kher replied, &ldquo;Agreed! As long as it is not confused with intolerance when others use it.&rdquo;
Agreed!!! As long as it is not confused with #Intolerance when others use it. Jai Ho and Jai Hind.😍🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 https://t.co/N5AJqOYnrg — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPKher) April 6, 2019
Alia Bhatt’s mother Soni Razdan argued, &ldquo;If you can align yourself to the present government, why would you think others doing the same is any different? Just curious.&rdquo; To which Kher said, &ldquo;Dearest Soni! It was an observation. Not a complaint.&rdquo;
Dearest Soni! It was an observation. Not a complaint.:) https://t.co/0c9pKOLHGj — Anupam Kher (@AnupamPKher) April 7, 2019
&ldquo;Our appeal - vote bigotry, hatred, and apathy out of power. Vote against the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and its allies... Vote for secular democratic, inclusive India... Vote wisely,&rdquo; read the statement.
