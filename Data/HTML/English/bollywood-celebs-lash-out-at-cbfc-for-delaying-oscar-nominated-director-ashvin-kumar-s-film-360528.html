No Fathers In Kashmir had earlier been denied a U certificate. Ashvin Kumar said that movie didn’t have any nude or vulgar scenes, and hence, he took his fight forward to FCAT and appealed against the fact it got an A certificate. However, he is juggling between the demands of the two bodies, which are reportedly ordering fresh cuts.

Amid all this, Bollywood celebs including Swara Bhaskar and Soni Razdan, who is also a part of the film, lashed out at CBFC.

Ashvin Kumar’s film #NoFathersinKashmir is facing CBFC problems. It’s stuck for months and despite FCAT orders he is not being given a hearing. The man is a fine film maker, an Oscar nominee in the past, and someone needs to help him. @prasoonjoshi_ Will you please? — Pritish Nandy (@PritishNandy) December 29, 2018
Oscar nominee & 2-time National Award winner @ashvinkumar’s new film @nofathers_movie #NoFathersInKashmir (tipped as 1 of 10 eagerly awaited films of 2019) remains banned over 6 months, delaying its release & forfeiting application for NationalAwards this year. Unconscionable! — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) January 10, 2019
Ashvin @ashvinkumar knows Kashmir so well. That’s the first thing I thought when I read this script. And that’s exactly why I so wanted to be a part of this project. For once I felt that here is a film that doesn’t pretend ... doesn’t mislead ... and most importantly doesn’t lie. pic.twitter.com/nYeIOMIFXg — Soni Razdan (@Soni_Razdan) January 16, 2019
2/3 It does so gently, with a lot of ironies, with tongue in cheek humour and a wonderful story full of courageous, innocent and sometimes foolish characters. No one is demonised. @prasoonjoshi_ @PritishNandy @ashvinkumar @ShashiTharoor @MaheshNBhatt — Soni Razdan (@Soni_Razdan) January 16, 2019
3/3 But everyone is real and human and so we feel that finally we are perhaps getting to know this wonderful place called Kashmir just a little bit better. Whoever sits on this board I do implore you to give truth and integrity a chance @prasoonjoshi_ @PritishNandy @ashvinkumar — Soni Razdan (@Soni_Razdan) January 16, 2019
