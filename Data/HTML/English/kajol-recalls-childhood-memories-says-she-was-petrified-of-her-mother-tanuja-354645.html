My mother was one of the most forward thinking people. I had the most amazing upbringing because of it. Topics like compassion, anger, forgiveness and death were discussed. Most things were not hidden. We were always told to take the most tolerant route and that revenge doesn't get you anything, she ws further quoted as saying.
During the trailer launch of Eela Helicopter too, Kajol mentioned how her mother was legendary with abuses and had the most creative ones but when Kajol pointed it out as a child, Tanuja stopped swearing.
Appreciating her mom, Kajol said, &quot;My mother always lead by example and that's what makes her the best.
She reiterated that she's learnt and understood the value of a mother when she became one. Eela helicoper is releasing today and is directed by Pradeep Sarkar.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
