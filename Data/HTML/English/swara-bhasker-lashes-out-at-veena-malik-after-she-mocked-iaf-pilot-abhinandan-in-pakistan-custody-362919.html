Her statement left Swara Bhasker fuming and she gave a befitting reply to the Pakistani actress. She replied in a very dignified and tweeted, &ldquo;Veena ji.. Shame on you & ur sick mindset. Your glee is just gross! Our officer is a hero- brave, gracious & dignified in the face of capture. At least some decency from that major in you army who was questioning #WingCommanderAbhinandan or the many Pakistanis suing 4 peace #sick.&rdquo;
