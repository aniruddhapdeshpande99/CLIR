&ldquo;So, Shah Rukh sir called me and said: 'It was my birthday a few days ago. It's just a chill dinner, so, come with your friends.' It was my first time at Mannat and I was so happy that it was a chill get-together for his birthday,&rdquo; Vicky said on a chat show.
So, Vicky Kaushal wore denims and T-shirt and a shirt over it.
&ldquo;I enter and see Kareena Kapoor Khan, Malaika Arora, everyone in like heavy Indian. Me, Taapsee, Rajkummar Rao... three-four of us were prepared for a birthday casual scene till we realised that we were so off. We were hanging out in one corner behind the curtain. I was so embarrassed because I was the first of that lot to enter.&rdquo;
