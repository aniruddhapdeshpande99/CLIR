&quot;I'll always handle social media by myself. I'll not have a team,&quot; he said. Siddhant came into the spotlight with Zoya Akhtar's latest film, where he portrayed MC Sher, mentor to Ranveer Singh's budding rapper Murad. &quot;I am happy, at peace, loving everything. But people don't know much about me,&quot; he said.
