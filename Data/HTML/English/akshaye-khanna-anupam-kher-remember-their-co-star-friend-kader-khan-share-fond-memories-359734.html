Indiatimes got in touch with Akshaye Khanna and Anupam Kher who have worked with the legendary actor.
Akshaye shared his fond memory about Kader Khan. He said,
&ldquo;I worked with him on two or three films but the maximum time I spent him was in New York while we were shooting for Aa Ab Laut Chale, he was playing a Pakistani, because it was outdoor in New York I spent a lot of time with him. I remember in the morning we used to go for a shoot in a mini van where I would sit behind him. I used to roll a paper like a needle and put it in his ears from the back very gently, like how a fly sits on our ears and there is a sensation, he would squirm a lot and I used to laugh so much.&quot;
&quot;I continued this for 3 or 4 days and then I got caught by him, he yelled at me so badly. He was a lovely guy, he was a child at heart, was a very nice and decent man, I will always have fond memories of Kader bhai&rdquo;.

Anupam Kher who has worked with him in several films has no words to describe the loss. He is extremely saddened by his death,
&ldquo;The problem with life is you lose people and you have to say it in one sentence what you lost and that’s not possible because your experience goes beyond one event or gesture. I have spent a lot of time with him, Sooryavansham has become a national iconic film since last 4 to 5 years, all my friends keep repeating our scenes together. Also, I spent a lovely time with him during Hum, every moment with was precious, he was a great scholar.&rdquo;
