Well, even worst of your nightmares would be better than this scenario, right? However, this has turned into a reality when a film's marketing team decided to promote the film, converting this nightmare into a strategy.
Just a few days ago, the trailer of Pihu was unveiled and it received a great response. The trailer sent chills down people's spine and people actually started looking forward to the film. The trailer had over 4.5 million views on YouTube.
But now, the film is being talked about on the internet and not for the right reasons.

People are labeling this idea as horrible and insensitive.

Journalist Sudhir Srinivasan wrote on Twitter that he had received &ldquo;a call from an anonymous number. A baby wailed about her mother and dad, and hung up. Disturbed, I tried calling back in vain. Got a message with a link to help the child. A link, as it turns out, of #Pihu‚Äôs trailer. A horrible idea, a disgusting invasion of privacy.&rdquo;
Another Twitter user said, &ldquo;Movie marketing has reached absurd levels.&quot;
Here are some reactions that prove how this is a classic case of marketing gone wrong.
Creepy. #Pihu

I loved the trailer of Pihu, but like calling people up from an unknown number as a part of a movie promotional strategy is fucking annoying. Especially when the phone call is of a baby crying for her parents. Movie marketing has reached absurd levels. ‚Äî Shreemi Verma (@shreemiverma) October 26, 2018

I just got a call from a child named Pihu who wanted desperate help. No. was 7024720657. THIS KIND OF MOVIE PROMOTION IS DISGUSTING TO SAY THE LEAST. ‚Äî Karan Bhardwaj (@journokaran) October 26, 2018

Watching Pihu's trailer was any parent's worst nightmare. And now people are getting call from a crying child, only to receive a link to the film‚Äôs trailer. Worst marketing campaign. https://t.co/kAr29rJji5 ‚Äî Teena Jain Kaushal (@Teena_Kaushal) October 27, 2018
