It all happened after Miss World Pageant in 1996 organized by the ABCL company had failed, and Bachchan was left with no money and all his properties were mortgaged. And then, Yash Raj offered him Mohabattein, a blockbuster movie that brought his career back on track. He did many commercials and shows like Kaun Banega Crorepati, through which he sustained and also paid off a debt of Rs 90 crores reportedly.

Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs life hasn‚Äôt been a best of roses, but he didn‚Äôt give up. He worked hard to rise up again. And indeed he did.
As he completes 50 years in the industry, the most special wish came for his son Abhishek Bachchan. Calling him an icon, best friend, guide, best critic and greatest support, Abhishek Bachchan said that he wants his father to rock another 50 years in Bollywood.
&quot;ICON!
To me, he's so much more. My father, best friend, guide, best critic, greatest support, idol..... HERO!
50 years today he started his journey in films. Even today, his passion and love for his craft and work is the same as I'm sure it was on the first day.
Dearest Pa, today we celebrate you, your talent, your passion, your brilliance and your immense influence.
Can't wait to see what you have in store for the next 50 years.
The coolest thing he taught me today....
As I went, in the morning to wish him for completing 50 years of being an actor and to tell him that I was leaving for work- I asked him where he was all ready to go to? He said..... To work! üí™&quot;
Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs inspiring journey is a lesson on why you shouldn‚Äôt ever give up.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
