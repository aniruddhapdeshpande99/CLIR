From calling him malnutritioned to massacred, Internet is upset with the look of the Lion. Before you check out the comments, watch the trailer and decide.

Here are some of the reactions and thoughts after seeing the trailer.
Look at how they MASSACRED my boyðŸ˜©#notmyscar pic.twitter.com/RCtYHQwTj3 â€” I Want Daddy Thanos to Snap My Asshole (@Reginald_Sass) April 10, 2019
okay, I like the new lion king trailer. Iâ€™m just wondering how weâ€™re supposed to tell these lions and lionesses apart when they all look like real animals. Scar isnâ€™t even darker or anything. He just looks like he got ran over by a truck. #NotMyScar â€” Alex (@Alexander_TG12) April 10, 2019
Disney took the majestic being that is Scar and turned him into a ragged lion without luscious, dark mane. Just.... why. #NotMyScar â€” Erin Laidley (@eclaidley) April 10, 2019
Also I am just going to say it. This is #NotMyScar. I will forever call this lion &quot;Not Scar&quot; because I refuse to believe that Not Scar is actually the wonderful villain from the superior 1994 film. pic.twitter.com/t46faO1Qqm â€” T Y L ÆŽ R (@IntrepidMegan) April 10, 2019
WTF I watched the new lion king trailer and bruhhh whyâ€™d they do scar like that. He looks and sounds terrible. No one does that voice like Jeremy Irons. ðŸ™„ #smh #TheLionKing2019 #NotMyScar â€” Brandi S. (@Brandi_lynn87) April 11, 2019

I am officially boycotting The Lion King for the next 3 months because Jeremy Irons is not playing Scar. #NotMyScar â€” Jayson (@birdman15) April 10, 2019
Simba idolizes his father, King Mufasa, and takes to heart his own royal destiny. But not everyone in the kingdom celebrates the new cubâ€™s arrival. Scar, Mufasaâ€™s brother and former heir to the throne has plans of his own and is the villain of the film.
Directed by Jon Favreau, Lion King is all set to release on July 19, 2019.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
