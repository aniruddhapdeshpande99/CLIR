In fact, they soon became the most desirable couple of tinsel town and even signed a film together. (Wonder if everything was planned). But looks like Sara wants to get over this Kartik thing. Wonder how will the actor react to this as he thoroughly enjoyed all the attention of Sara.

Sara and Kartik will be seen next in Love Aaj Kal sequel directed by Imtiaz Alia. The original Love Aaj Kal had Sara’s dad Saif Ali Khan in the lead role opposite Deepika Padukone. On professional front Sara is doing exceptionally well, her first film Kedranath proved she is one of the promising actresses in tinsel town. Simmba did disappoint one bit as we didn't get to see more of her. But the girl sure knows how to be in news with or without films.
