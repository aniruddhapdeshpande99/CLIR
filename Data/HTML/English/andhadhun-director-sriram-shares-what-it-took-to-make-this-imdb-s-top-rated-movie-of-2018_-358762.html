&quot;A film like this not only requires complete creative freedom but also the belief and support of its producer, and I got that abundantly from Sanjay Routray and Matchbox Pictures. Looking forward to more such collaborations.&quot;
Earlier this year, AndhaDhun emerged as a runaway success at the box office, winning high critical acclaim and big audience applause. It is also the top Indian movie of 2018, as determined by IMDb customer ratings.
&quot;What began as shared passion for us has culminated in recognition from audiences. I am very grateful to Star Screen Awards for these awards, and to Sriram for his unique, uncompromising vision,&quot; Routray said.
