As a father, my only advice to him is that he should play leads but only those that are characters. This is a rule I follow and really believe in. More than being a hero, you need to live a character on screen. Thatâ€™s the joy of acting.&rdquo;
He further added that he's proud of the fact that he has pulled off characters that have managed to stay in the hearts of people. He added,

During the interaction, Aamir was asked if we will ever get to see a biopic on his life to which he had an interesting reply. Talking about the possibilities of who could reprise his role in his biopic, he took his son Junaid's name. He said, &ldquo;I think Junaid (his son) can do it. He might be a good choice.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
