T-Pain Accused Of Plagiarising Aashiqui 2 Song Tum Hi Ho, Gets Trolled By 'Brown Twitter'
A lot of Indian composers have often become a butt of jokes for getting 'inspired' by international songs and artists. However, it doesnâ€™t take a genius to figure out plagiarism, right?
What happened recently is definitely a rarity. American rapper T-Pain has been accused of plagiarising a recurring flute melody from Arijit Singhâ€™s popular song from Aashiqui 2, Tum Hi Ho.
Filmâ€™s director Mohit Suri was the first one who brought this to peopleâ€™s attention.
Music composer Mithoon was also taken aback when it came to his notice.
Sir, the melody that you have used in your new song is my original work for a previously released Hindi film..The Label is looking into this.#tumhiho #Aashiqui2 https://t.co/5fnDf4sfg7 â€” Mithoon (@Mithoon11) December 15, 2018
And soon, T-pain became a victim of trolls. He was facing the wrath of &ldquo;brown twitter&rdquo;, he said.

Cannot believe T pain sampled Tum Hi Ho ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m so dead â€” Bhad Bhai (@DerrKaiser) December 15, 2018

He took to twitter to clarify that he didnâ€™t produce the tune, and also stated that it was a small matter and his label was looking into it.
Woke up to getting dragged by brown twitter. Sooooo yea. I definitely didnâ€™t produce this song. Had no idea that was a sample and have never heard the music before I got the beat from the producer. Easy thing to work out. The labels will be in contact. Thanx â€” T-Pain (@TPAIN) December 15, 2018
Some people were just amazed by seeing all this happening for real.
The irony in seeing Bollywood fans attacking T Pain for sampling Tum Hi Ho on a trap beat, when Bollywood literally takes a WHOLE composition claiming it as their own track.
C'mon guys, lol. â€” Bhaveek N. Makan (@TehBhav) December 16, 2018
Meanwhile, T-painâ€™s song which was titled Thatâ€™s Yo Money has been pulled off from YouTube. But itâ€™s still available on other channels and fan pages. If you want to know whatâ€™s all the ruckus about, listen to the tune below:
This isnâ€™t the first time that T-series has been embroiled in an international battle. Remember the labelâ€™s feud with Swedish internet celebrity PewDiePie over YouTube followers? They are competing against each other for most followed YouTube channel. In the recent development, after YouTube purged spam accounts, PewDiePie has once again beaten T-Series as the most subscribed channel.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
