After The Iconic Victory, Celebrations Continue For Lovebirds Virat Kohli And Anushka Sharma
2019 has begun on quite an iconic note for the Indian National Cricket team after their victory in Sydney. The win has also been super special for the Captain of the cricket team as the team broke the 71-year old jinx.
The celebrations turned even more special as Kohli was joined by his wife Anushka in Sydney. She took to Instagram to write a note for her love. She wrote,
&quot;History is written and created by this bunch!! Huge congratulations to all players, coaching unit and support staff.&quot;
That was just the beginning of the celebration as the couple later hogged on food and cake. Along with other friends, the pictures looked like a full-house celebration of the victory.
