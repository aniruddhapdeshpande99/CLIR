Naseeruddin Shah has apparently turned Amnesty Indiaâ€™s ambassador and in one of their recently released videos, he can be seen talking about &ldquo;massive crackdown on freedom of expression and human rights defenders&rdquo; and expressing concern over muzzling &ldquo;voices of dissent&rdquo;.

The campaign is called â€˜Ab Ki Baar Manav Adhikaar'. Interestingly, the pictures used in the video during his monologue are of urban naxals.
In the video, he says, &ldquo;Those who demand rights are being locked away. Artists, actors scholars, poets are all being stifled. Journalists too are being silenced. In the name of religion, walls of hate are being erected. Innocents are being killed.

&ldquo;Had we dreamt of a country where there is no space for dissent? Where only rich and powerful are heard, and where the poorest and most vulnerable are forever oppressed? Where there once was law, there is now only darkness&rdquo;.
Hereâ€™s the video:
In 2018, India witnessed a massive crackdown on freedom of expression and human rights defenders. Let's stand up for our constitutional values this new year and tell the Indian government that its crackdown must end now. #AbkiBaarManavAdhikaar pic.twitter.com/e7YSIyLAfm â€” Amnesty India (@AIIndia) January 4, 2019

He should be fired from India â€” Rammy singh (@rammysingh06) January 4, 2019
India does not need Disrupters like @AmnestyIndia , the Nation has been made to bleed hugely by such deceptive and hypocrite organisations who are more engaged in secessionist and antiGovernment antiPeople activities. Need a blanket ban on #Amnesty & its affiliates in diff grabs. pic.twitter.com/zFqmPafXqQ â€” RomeshNadirðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (@RomeshNadir) January 5, 2019
In response to his statement, Emraan Hashmi recently said that he is unable to express his opinion on the entire hoopla.
Actor Emraan Hashmi on Naseeruddin Shah's remark: I am able to express what I am thinking right now. I think there is freedom of speech in our country, I am a bit ignorant of the controversy. So, it will be a bit irresponsible of me to speak on that. pic.twitter.com/Ma3VbtxHXB â€” ANI (@ANI) January 4, 2019</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
