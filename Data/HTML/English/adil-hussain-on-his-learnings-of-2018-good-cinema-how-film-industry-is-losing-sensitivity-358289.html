Hussain is an actor who is not just critically acclaimed but his latest victory boasts of an award as prestigious as a Best Actor award at the Norwegian national awards in Haugesund. He wasn't just the first Indian to win such an award but his humility won a lot of hearts when he dedicated this victory to his hometown in Assam. After winning the award, he said:
&ldquo;This is for the Goalpara, Assam for all those believe that art can break all boundaries of all kinds. My hometown, small as it is, inspired me to break free from the boundaries that suppress. If you have passion and love, you can break boundaries — and Goalpara helped me do it.&rdquo;

Well, that was just a part of his year, which was a year of rewards, awards and an overwhelming response from all his fans. 2018 can be summed up as one of the most successful years of his career by now and he too echoed similar thoughts when we sat to chat with the actor. We spoke to him about the highlights of his year, how he chooses his roles and what why the Hindi film industry disappoints him. Read now!
1. As an actor and performer, whose films have received validation across the globe, how would you describe 2018?
AH: A rewarding and validating one. It feels good to put in efforts and working on scripts. It's not just about choosing the right kind of directors and scripts but it's also about these right scripts and directors choosing you. It makes me feel content and happy that my intuition and instincts as an actor are working.

2. Is there any strategy that you follow in your head to choose the roles? Considering most them end up being talked about for being so powerful and strong.
AH: Selection of roles has never been about following a strategy. For me, it's an internal process. It's about how I feel biologically after reading the synopsis. I need to feel good after reading it and then it's all about intellectual deliberation. If I feel that the story should be relevant and if I see that there is a proper relationship sync between the characters, I take them up. Every role I pick should be properly fleshed out and shouldn't be single-dimensional. And most importantly, it has to touch me somewhere.

3. Your role in What Will People Say is being talked about a lot. It is an intense dark character. When you pick up these roles, how do you prepare for them? Are these roles emotionally daunting?
AH: It doesn't really take a toll on me but every role is demanding. Be it a character that is in deep crisis or in anguish- even a light-hearted role is equally demanding-it demands my complete attention. Focus-Concentration-Alertness-Awareness are a few of the pre-requisites for me. These efforts are not an extra fee for a role that I take up.

4. Your film What Will People Say swept a lot of awards internationally and Norway has selected What Will People Say (Hva vil folk si) for the best foreign-language film Oscar consideration. Did you see all this coming when you chose the film?
AH: When I took up this movie, I had no clue who the director was. I just read a few things about her and I loved the script and went in it. And when it was nominated by Norwegian and they also gave us three awards, it was overwhelming. It vindicates my belief that these are the kind of films I have always wanted to work on, these are the subjects that should be talked about. The sense of contentment and satisfaction was really overwhelming. I feel validated.

5. As an actor, we see you fearlessly voicing your opinion on social media. How do you wish to exploit the platform as a medium?
AH: I only respond to issues or voice an opinion about things that I deeply believe in and I try to make sure that the language that I am using isn't hurtful but yet must tell the truth-Not in a bitter way. My purpose is never to hurt any person, organization or a group of people but it has always been about putting my point across. I am a self-aware person who asks: What and Why I am saying it? I see things from every point of view before voicing my opinion. What I am saying should not hurt anyone's ego. I am here to communicate, put across my points on a medium. I question my intent before putting across my opinions.

6. A lot of times, actors in the Hindi film industry are typecast. As an actor, don't you think that doing similar roles can put you in a box?
AH: Yes. I have been approached several times for a similar kind of roles. Especially in the Indian film industry, people don’t want to work hard on being imaginative about casting. They want similar people for similar roles. It’s a pity and a tragedy for actors. I have vehemently opposed and turned down roles. I have been offered so many policemen roles and I have blatantly turned them down. At an age of 49, I have been offered roles of these big A-listers father and I have turned all these roles down. I will not play a father in commercial films. The Indian film industry has a habit of stereotyping and type-casting you on the basis of your age and not your talent. I have been a trained comedian, stand-up comedian but I have never been offered a comic role, which is sad.
7. As an actor, what has been the most disappointing thing till now? Something you wish that changes in the film industry.
AH: Films are one the most powerful mediums after television. When we are dealing with this powerful medium, as actors, producers, writers, directors, distributors or as an actor, or be it the creative heads-these are the people responsible to utilize this powerful medium. But what disappoints me how it is not used responsibly. There are several aspects: We are using it only to make profits. We are only driven and talking numbers. When we know we have the power to influence people’s mind, the psyche of youngest of people in the country, I am not sure we are passing on the right things in the name of art or cinema. 99.9% of us are not acting responsibly. If we ask where we see our society in the next 20 years, I don’t see cinema playing a significant role because we are irresponsible. We are not taking responsibility because we are driven by profits and greed.
I find the jargon of ‘100 crores’ is very disappointing.

8. The whole me-too movement found its way and came to India. A lot of people were named and shamed. What are your thoughts?
AH: Me too movement doesn’t just exist only in the industry but it ‘also’ exists in the industry, which is really sad because it should not have existed here in the first place. But we as people who are associated with films and art of cinema, if we are losing sensitivity as human beings, there is something deeply disappointing. If people in a powerful position (be it actor, director, producer or a writer) is taking advantage of a woman’s vulnerability, then it is extremely sad. If we are not sensitive towards women even after being in a responsible position, then it defeats the purpose of being the field of art.
If we can’t see women as equal or most probably as our superior (which they of course are.). What a man can do, a woman can do too but all the things that a woman can do, a man can never have the capacity to do it. Women are superior biologically and only foolish men can think of women as their inferior.
We are supposed to be the most empathizing and sensitive ones and if we indulge and behave this way, it is sad. Thank god, people are speaking up! I hope men start introspecting about their behavior towards women. We study, get into the field of films and suddenly turn into money-making machines with no soul. We are losing sensitivity as human beings and it is very sad.&quot;

9. What are your key-takeaways from 2018?
&quot;I have learned that it's important to relax when I talk about relaxation, it also means not expecting rewards for my work. But I do expect results. Results, because they tell me if the amount of hard work I am putting in, is going in the right direction and fetching me results. If I am at rest, feeling peaceful. After I finish acting in my film, I stop thinking about all of it. I only think about it if there is an impending cheque or payment (laughs!)</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
