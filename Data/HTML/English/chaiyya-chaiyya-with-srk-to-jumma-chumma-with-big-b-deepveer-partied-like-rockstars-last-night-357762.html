A lot of celebrities made heads turn as they walked in to attend the crazy bash of the much-in-love couple. Katrina Kaif turned out to be a vision in white, Farhan Akhtar walked hand-in-hand with rumoured girlfriend Shibani Dandekar, Munna Bhai and Circuit reunited, Katrina Kaif attended the bash too – there’s a lot that grabbed a lot of eyeballs last night.
And then the real party began. Every woman’s dream man, Ranveer Singh proclaimed last night that he is one &ldquo;obedient husband&rdquo; and will always listen to what his better half says.

&ldquo;The key to success in life is to yes to everything she says… So when baby says ‘babe change the vibe of the music’, I have to oblige… babe this one is for you!&rdquo;
Ranveer Singh was high on happiness. So much so, that he showcased his inner Bollywood buff, flaunted his high-voltage dance moves and pulled everyone to the dance floor.
He made the legendary Amitabh Bachchan groove with him on Jumma Chumma! Yeah, only Ranveer Singh can do that!
What’s more? He even recreated the iconic Chaiyya Chaiyya with Shah Rukh Khan and Malaika Arora.
Deepika Padukone also partied like a boss on Disco Dancer.
Not only did he dance, but Ranveer Singh also sang at his party! While last time he took over the DJ console at his reception, in this one, he turned into a rapper.
Letting bygones be bygones, Katrina Kaif also arrived at the DeepVeer's reception!
Yo Yo Honey Singh was also seen at the bash!
It was fun, laughter and happiness!
It was a certainly a night to remember!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
