Ali Fazal Was Warned By Four Leading Directors Of Bollywood To Not Take Up Mirzapur
Ali Fazal is right now on cloud nine as his first web series Mirzapur has left the world talking. The show is gritty and grippy and Ali has done a fabulous job in it as a gangster along with Vikrant Massey who plays his brother.
Ali who is basking success with Mirzapur revealed to Indiatimes on how he was warned by 4 big film directors to not do the show as it would be bad for his career.

Ali said,
&ldquo;Four very big directors of Bollywood told me, Mirzapur will be bad for my career, anyway its a true reminder for everyone that times are changing and there is a lot of new talent. Also, there is Sacred Games series which has been appreciated on the web by far and of course, there are other few shows too, and now Mirzapur is considered a sensible show, barring the violence.&rdquo;
Ali recalls how he got his very first web series, &ldquo;Mirzapur came to me long back when I was promoting Victoria & Abdul, I was not looking to do web series that time, as I was busy with films, I had to shift one of my films for this. I just loved the script and couldn’t let this go from my hand. It is such a well-written script, it was amazing to see that there are so many dimensional in the show and not one.&rdquo;

He even said, &ldquo;If I was a producer I wouldn’t cast Ali Fazal in the show because I know what kind of roles I can do, but not others, so I was very happy to see people fighting for me with producers that I am fit for this role.&rdquo;
Twitter
Ali didn’t get a big break for his Bollywood debut, in fact, he didn’t even get a full-fledged film. He made his debut with a cameo in 3 Idiots. Talking about not picking a full-fledged film for his Bollywood debut, he said, &ldquo;I was a college boy when I was offered 3 Idiots, I found it cool to work in films and so I did it, I didn’t even know Aamir Khan will be the actor in the film. Also, honestly I never knew how the film industry works, I was heavily into my maths and economics, I never wanted to pursue my career in films, it just happened.&rdquo;
Twitter
We asked Ali on how he deals with failures, he said,
&ldquo;My heartbreak was when my first solo film Always Kabhi Kabhi didn’t work, it was Shah Rukh Khan producing, a musical film, I didn’t understand the concept of dealing with failures that time. Humne toh yahi dekha tha Bhaiya, ‘Shah Rukh Khan ki film chalti hai, Dharma ki film badi hit hoti hai, I had that very small town thought.
When the film came and went, and nobody knew about it, I was like 'ye kya hua', I was numb for 6 months, that was my crashing point. After that I learned, this is life, this happens, if there is one hit, there are 5 flops.&rdquo;

Also, somebody very wise told me –this is Saeed Akhtar Mirza, technically that was my first film with him which never came out, he gave me this brilliant advice – Don’t forget to enjoy the journey, this will pass by, one day you will have hits. I mean Bachchan sahab’s 80 percent films have flopped, only 30 films of him are super duper hit and he still is a megastar.
Ali shares how he started his acting career,
&ldquo;I started acting in depression, I had broken my hand, had to leave basketball, then I started debating and acting and even started winning awards, I suddenly realized that I am discovering this huge world and it can’t end with this one film. Also, I told my dad to not support me financially, so there are times I have done films where I had no money, today I wouldn’t do those 2 or 3 films which I have done in past, it was shoddy direction and horrible production, but everybody has been through that in life.&rdquo;
Fazal revealed that he hasn't seen any of his films after Fukrey, &ldquo;Fukrey again was a surprise for me because I had decided to quit. After Fukrey, people told me I am a good actor, I thought I was horrible in it, and since then I have stopped watching my work, I didn’t watch Mirzapur.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
