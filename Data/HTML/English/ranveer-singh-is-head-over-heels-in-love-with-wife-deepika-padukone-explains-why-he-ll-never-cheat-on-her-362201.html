Ranveer Singh Is Head Over Heels In Love With Wife Deepika Padukone, Explains Why He’ll Never Cheat On Her
Ranveer Singh’s love for Deepika Padukone is unconditional. With their PDA and love-filled gestures, DeepVeer, as they are fondly called, have been winning the hearts of their fans over and over again.
But Ranveer Singh just can’t get enough of Deepika Padukone. From showering love upon her on every Instagram post to being in awe of her almost all the time, he has proven he is the husband of the millennium.
When Karan Johar asked Ranveer Singh recently that if being around so many gorgeous ladies, it will be a difficult task to resist, he said:
Don't Miss 185 SHARES 460 SHARES 544 SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 411 SHARES
&ldquo;I have bagged myself the top most chick, so what do I have to worry about. I have never met anybody in my life who has captivated me like the way she does. I have been seeing her for six years before we got married and that is testament to the fact that no other person has been, or will be good enough to tempt me. She (Deepika) is really something else,&rdquo; Ranveer Singh was quoted as saying on Film Companion’s Tapecase, where he appeared along with Karan Johar.
This Valentine’s Day, Ranveer Singh spent time with Deepika Padukone and her family. The couple attended an award function along with Deepika's father Prakash Padukone, who was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution in sports. And like a perfect son-in-law, he rooted for his father-in-law too. Take a look.
Meanwhile, Ranveer Singh is basking in the success of his latest release Gully Boy.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
