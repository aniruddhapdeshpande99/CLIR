Author of ‘Calling Sehmat’ Hints At The Sequel Of Alia Bhatt And Vicky Kaushal Starrer 'Raazi'
Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal's movie Raazi proved to be one of the biggest winners at the box-office in 2018. The film's victory also proved that we are more than welcoming towards female-led stories. The film won the hearts of the fans and the critics and Bhatt's performance gained her a lot of praises.
You might be living under a rock if you are unaware of the fact that the movie was based on the Harinder Sikka's novel Calling Sehmat. And now, if reports are to be believed, a sequel to Raazi is already on the cards.
Dharma productions
The report has been confirmed by Harinder Sikka, the author of ‘Calling Sehmat’.
A mid-day report quotes the author as saying,
Dharma Productions
&quot;After I wrote Calling Sehmat in 2008, I spent another 10 years with her, on and off, depending on the little time she gave me. [The book will focus on] how she went into depression after the mission but fought her way out of it. It will reflect her personal journey since her return from Pakistan. The mysteries around her will be decoded in Remembering Sehmat.&quot;
There is also a strong buzz that Alia Bhatt was also a part of the discussion around the sequel.

While neither KJo's production house nor the actors have given any sort of confirmation on the same. But considering how successful the first part was, who wouldn't want to bet the money on the sequel?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
