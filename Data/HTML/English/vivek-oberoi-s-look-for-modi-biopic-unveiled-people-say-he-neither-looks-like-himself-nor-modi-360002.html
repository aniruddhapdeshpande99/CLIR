The internet had a field day when the news of Vivek Oberoi playing the role of PM Modi spread on the internet. The film was announced and people couldn't help but crack jokes around it. Today, the news got officially confirmed as 42-year-old Vivek Oberoi took to Twitter to share the first look poster. He wrote,
जय हिन्द. జై హింద్. ஜெய் ஹிந்த். Jai Hind 🇮🇳🙏 We humbly ask for your prayers and blessings on this incredible journey. #AkhandBharat #PMNarendraModi pic.twitter.com/t0lQVka7mJ — Vivek Anand Oberoi (@vivekoberoi) January 7, 2019

Vivek Oberoi was tired of being a villain in the south Indian movies. So he decided to be a villain for the whole country. https://t.co/REawSL01J9 — Extremus Maximus (@Mercurial_Zen) January 7, 2019</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
