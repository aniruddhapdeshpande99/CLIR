Personally, this one is my favorite from the lot. While i do agree that we have seen the same story more than once but the lead couple was a breath of fresh air. Could you ever imagine Bradley Cooper singing his own songs? Or see Lady Gaga in her most natural form and portraying emotions so beautifully? No, right? Special mention for the music score. The entire album has been created so magnificently. The song Shallow even went on to bag a Golden Globe earlier.
The plot revolves around a successful country music artist Jackson Maine who is battling alcohol and drug addiction. He is in a self destruction mode when fate makes him cross paths with an amateur singer Ally. He is not just mesmerised with her voice but falls in love with her almost instantly. The story then unfolds with Maine helping Ally become a Star!

A biopic-comedy, Vice narrates the story of former US Vice President Dick Cheney played by none other than Christian Bale. It follows the journey of Cheney of becoming the most powerful Vice President in the history of America. Boasting of an impressive resume which includes stints of working as White House chief of staff, House Minority Whip and Defence secretary. Bale is known for attempting some of the most difficult roles throughout his career and this one was no different.
He gained 40 plus pounds and shaved his head to look like the man who was second in command during some of the darkest days in American history. Despite getting beaten by George W Bush by a narrow margin, Cheney uses his power to reshape the country. Bale is touted to take his second Oscar home with this film and so are the makeup and other technicians for transforming lead characters to look like their real counterparts.
6. First Man - 4 nominations

Aptly titled First Man takes you on the journey of Astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to reach the moon. Helmed by six-time Academy Award winning director Damien Chazelle. Teaming up with Ryan Gosling once again after La La Land, the riveting story of NASA’s mission to land a man on the moon, this film is a visceral first-hand account from Armstrong’s perspective. Showcasing the time between 1961-1969, it exhibits the sacrifices and difficulties that Armstrong and the nation went through to accomplish the historic mission. Even thought First Man didn’t bag nominations in the major categories, it got three nods in the technical ones.
7. Mary Poppins Returns - 4 nominations

Just when he meets a dead end, he and his family have a visitor Mary Poppins, the beloved nanny from his childhood who not only saves the day but also take the family on a magical adventure.
A fairly recent release, this musical drama bagged 4 Academy nominations mostly in the music and technical categories. The film won’t just make you reminiscent of your childhood days but will also entertain you with it’s foot-tapping music. What’s more Emily Blunt’s performance is definitely the highlight of this film.
8. Roma - 10 nominations

Roma isn’t a conventional film for Oscars. However, it has still become the frontrunner this year.First things first, Roma is a Netflix film and it is in Spanish. Oh and also, it’s a black and white film! This hasn’t deterred the film from bagging as many as 10 nominations at the Academy awards this year.
