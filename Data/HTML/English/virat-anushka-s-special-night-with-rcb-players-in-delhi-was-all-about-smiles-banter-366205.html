Virat-Anushka's Special Night With RCB Players In Delhi Was All About Smiles & Banter!
No matter how busy they are with their professional commitments, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma make it a point to spend some time with each other and have a good time. The couple tied the knot in Tuscany, Italy in December 2017 and they're enjoying every moment of the marital bliss.
Kohli is currently busy with his commitments related to IPL but that isn't stopping him from taking a break and having fun with his wife Anushka or his RCB teammates!
The couple visited Virat Kohli's restaurant Nueva in New Delhi last evening and they were joined in by the team players of Royal Challengers Bangalore. Even with their friends around, it was a perfect date night for Virushka, who were seen kissing, hugging and just having a good time with each other.

Just a few months ago, Anushka had opened up about Virat Kohli and revealed that he has every quality of a good life partner. She was quoted in a report as saying,
&quot;Everything is real. Also, the fact that we both support each other. He’s someone, who’s constantly trying to get better professionally and as an individual. I’m also like that. We don’t take ourselves so seriously. We’re similar people. That’s why we get along.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
