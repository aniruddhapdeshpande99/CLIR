&quot;Terming the Test series win in Australia his &quot;biggest achievement&quot; in the career so far, Kohli rated it above India's World Cup win in 2011. Kohli delivered an inspirational speech after the victory. He said,
&quot;By far this is my best achievement. Has to be on top of the pile. When we won the World Cup, I was a young player. I saw the others getting emotional. This series will give us a different identity as a team. What we've been able to achieve is something to be really proud of.&quot;
Anushka was overwhelmed by Virat's phenomenal achievement.

Huge congratulations to all players, coaching unit and support staff; it takes undying perseverance & solid conviction to focus on what’s important and shut out the rest. So so happy and proud of you my love @virat.kohli
