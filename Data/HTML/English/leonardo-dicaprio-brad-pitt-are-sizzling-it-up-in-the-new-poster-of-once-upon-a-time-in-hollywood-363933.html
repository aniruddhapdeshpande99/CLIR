Leonardo DiCaprio & Brad Pitt Are Sizzling It Up In The New Poster Of 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood'
The Quentin Tarantino-directed film is finally here. Hollywood actor Brad Pitt has joined Leonardo DiCaprio in for an upcoming Manson movie. The film is titled 'Once Upon A Time in Hollywood'.
Twitter
Tarantino, who is writing and directing the film, has described the project as &ldquo;a story that takes place in Los Angeles in 1969, at the height of hippy Hollywood.&quot;
And the new posters are giving the same vibe. Take a look.

DiCaprio will play Rick Dalton, former star of a western TV series, while Pitt will be his longtime stunt double, Cliff Booth. &ldquo;Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don’t recognise anymore. But Rick has a very famous next-door neighbour...Sharon Tate,&rdquo; said Tarantino in an interview.

&ldquo;I’ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was 7 years old. I’m very excited to tell this story of an LA and a Hollywood that don’t exist anymore. And I couldn’t be happier about the dynamic teaming of DiCaprio and Pitt as Rick and Cliff,&rdquo; he added.
Some of the fans are not happy with the poster and are labelling it as photoshop. One person tweeted, &ldquo;Remember when REAL artist would paint real works of art for posters… Sigh, I mean I am still excited as hell for this movie but this poster is lame as f---!&rdquo;
Another social media user wrote, &ldquo;Brad Pitt looks photoshopped,&rdquo; while another chimed in saying the poster looked as though Pitt’s face was fixed over Matthew McConaughey’s body.

ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD is the first Tarantino I'll have seen since JACKIE BROWN where I didn't read the screenplay ahead of time. I know a *few* things about it, but basically nothing. That's so, so exciting. — Scott Wampler™ (@ScottWamplerBMD) March 18, 2019
