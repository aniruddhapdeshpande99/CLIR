The terrorist was driving a sedan which had 60 kg RDX that blew up in a 150-metre radius. The bomber detonated the explosives right next to bus.
Since then, there has been an outburst against Pakistan after Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed it was their doing. While some want Pakistan to be declared as a terrorist state, others are cutting off all ties with the country.
Navjot Singh Sidhu, has been sacked from The Kapil Sharma Show, after he said, only a handful of people are responsible for this and we should not blame the entire country. Such is the uproar in the country who have taken a pledge to not forget or forgive.
And now All India Cine Workers have announced a complete ban of Pakistani artists working in Bollywood from here on. Here’s the official notice released by the top cinema body:
