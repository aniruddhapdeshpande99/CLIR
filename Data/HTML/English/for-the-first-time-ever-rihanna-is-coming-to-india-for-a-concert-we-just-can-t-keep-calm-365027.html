This will be the first ever time that she will be performing in India. Earlier as well, grapevine was abuzz that she would perform in India last year but then, it turned out the rumours were all false.

It is said that Riri will perform in Mumbai on October 19. &ldquo;Yes, Rihanna will be coming to India for the first time this year and will be performing in Mumbai,&rdquo; an insider was quoted a source as saying by Pinkvilla.

So ladies and gentlemen, while Beyonce might be against performing in India unless it’s a private concert for the Amabanis, Rihanna is definitely game for it. We have seen Justin Bieber, The Chainsmokers and Coldplay performing in India in last couple of years, but Rihanna will perform for the first ever time.

Just like Justin Bieber demanded a washing machine, refrigerator and Kerala masseuse, will Rihanna have crazy demands too? Will she throw any tantrums? Well, only time will tell.
