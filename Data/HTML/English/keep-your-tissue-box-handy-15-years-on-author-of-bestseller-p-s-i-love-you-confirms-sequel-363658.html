The synopsis explains that Holly is approached by a group called the â€˜PS, I Love You Clubâ€™.

&ldquo;Her safe existence is turned on its head. Inspired by hearing about her late husband Gerryâ€™s letters, the club wants Holly to help them with their own parting messages for their loved ones to discover after theyâ€™re gone. Holly is sure of one thing â€“ no way is she being dragged back to the grief she has left behind. Itâ€™s taken seven years to reinvent herself, and sheâ€™s ready to move on with her life. But Holly comes to realise that when you love someone, thereâ€™s always one more thing to sayâ€¦&quot;
In a statement, Cecelia Ahern said,
Twitter
&ldquo;Postscript is the PS to my PS and while it is a sequel, it is also a story that stands alone about living a purposeful life in the face of illness, grief and loss. I hope that new readers and PS, I Love You fans alike will embrace Hollyâ€™s new journey.&quot;
