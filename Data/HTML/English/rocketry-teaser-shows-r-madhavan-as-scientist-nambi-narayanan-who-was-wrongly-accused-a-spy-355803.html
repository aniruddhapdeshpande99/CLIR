Why was he arrested? He was accused by Central Bureau for selling highly confidential information, including drawings of ISRO’s Vikas engine and cryogenic technology, to Maldivian women who then passed it on to Pakistan. He was then in-charge of ISRO's cryogenics division and was arrested with four others.
For 50 days he was in custody and he said, he was tortured and pressed to give false statements. He fought the long battle to be proven non-guilty later.
