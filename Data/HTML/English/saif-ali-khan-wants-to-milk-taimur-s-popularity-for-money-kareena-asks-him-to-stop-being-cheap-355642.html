Saif who is busy with Bazaar promotions jokingly said how he is ready to sell his son Taimur's popularity but is wifey Kareena asked him to stop being cheap.
In an interview with RJ and anchor Sidharth Kanan, Saif said,
&ldquo;My wife says, ‘Don’t be so cheap. You can’t sell your son (Taimur)’. I am like, ‘Why not? Let’s sell him’. Seriously yaar, he is anyway there on the internet. I am just using this platform to say if anybody has any good nappy ads or anything... at a very reasonable price...it’s not reasonable, it’s quite expensive actually. And, I won’t give him the money also. I’ll give him some cash for his education, I am already giving it to him. And I’ll spend the rest!&rdquo;.
