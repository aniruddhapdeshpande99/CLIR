Be it compelling biopics or making homosexual love stories, film directors are open to experimentation and taking up bigger risks and challenges. Bollywood producer and director Karan Johar expressed his desire of taking up a project to direct the unconventional tale of love between a gay couple.
Johar was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he expressed his desire to create a homosexual love story that comes from the heart. He said that his idea of ‘heartfelt gay romance’ would feature two lead actors who as of now remain undecided. He said,
&ldquo;Being a leading filmmaker, I can make movies on the subject. I would love to make a homosexual love story and would want to cast two leading actors in the film. I don’t have in mind specific names of the actors I want to cast in the film, but I surely want to make such a film.&quot;
