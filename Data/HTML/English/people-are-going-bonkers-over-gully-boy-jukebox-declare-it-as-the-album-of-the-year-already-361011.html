People Are Going Bonkers Over Gully Boy Jukebox, Declare It 'The Album Of The Year' Already!
If you are still obsessing over Apna Time Ayega from Gully Boy, you would be delighted to know that this movie has 18 songs. The music of the movie was launched yesterday in Mumbai, in the presence of the two superstars Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt.
Being the crazy man he is, Ranveer Singh’s energy was at its peak at the music launch event as well. Dressed up in neon green tracksuit, the sea of fans cheered as Ranveer Singh took the centre stage. He sang for the audiences too. It was nothing short of a great concert.
