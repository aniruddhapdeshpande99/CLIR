&ldquo;How‚Äôs the Josh? High Sir!&rdquo; ‚Äì These lines instantly fill you up with all the patriotic vibe. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to little kids, all those who have watched Vicky Kaushal starrer Uri: The Surgical Strike are going bonkers over this dialogue from the movie.
Indeed, Vicky Kaushal pulled off the role Major Vihaan Singh Sherghil so well that people were reminded of Sunny Deol from Border. The only difference was ‚Äì Vicky showed less intensity yet made a powerful impact with his impeccable acting skills. So much so, that Anupam Kher lauded his performance in the movie and welcomed him to the &ldquo;actor‚Äôs world&rdquo;. Interestingly, Anupam Kher‚Äôs The Accidental Prime Minister released on the same date as Uri: The Surgical Strike, and the latter made more noise than the former.

Just like how actors like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Rajkummar Rao and Irrfan Khan among others have made their own league in the industry, Vicky Kaushal has also shown his range of acting in different films earning critical as well as commercial success.
Not many people know that he is a star-kid too. He is the son of a well-known stunt director Shyam Kaushal. But that didn‚Äôt give him a sure shot ticket to stardom. Unlike other star kids, Vicky Kaushal hadn‚Äôt stepped on to the sets of films until he started assisting Anurag Kashyap on Gangs Of Wasseypur.

Did you know, he is an engineer by degree? But he always knew what he wanted to become ‚Äì an actor.

He even got selected but tore off the offer letter so he could follow his dreams.
