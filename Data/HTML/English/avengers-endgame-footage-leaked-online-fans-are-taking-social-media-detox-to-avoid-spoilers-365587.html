Stop with the #AvengersEndgame leaks. This is ridiculous. Also, don't watch a pirated version of this movie on your sad little computer. This film deserves to be watched in a theater not in your mom's basement. â€” BJ The Web Guy (@BJtheWebGuy) April 16, 2019

Disney had kept the film so shrouded that even journalists and critics were not shown the movie. Only 10 minutes of Avengers: Endgame was screened for the press in Los Angeles. Furthermore, 20 minutes of the movie were screened for select members of the press in South Korea.
It is said that the 5-minute video that has leaked is reportedly from the screening in South Korea. However, nothing can be confirmed as of now. But Marvel fans, beware of social media! Like a true fan, we suggest, you should watch Avengers: Endgame in the theatres on April 26.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
