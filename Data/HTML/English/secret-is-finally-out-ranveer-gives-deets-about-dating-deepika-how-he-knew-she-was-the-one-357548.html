&quot;Whatever she wished, I wanted her to have it. That’s the first step in being the husband of the millennium. Whatever her vision of getting married, I wanted her to realize it. Whatever she wanted, it was done exactly in that manner. She deserves every bit of it. I too deserve happiness and my happiness comes from her happiness. It’s that simple.&quot;
Ranveer spilled the beans on the 'this is it' moment of their relationship. He added,

&quot;Six months into the relationship, I knew she was the one. I nurtured the relationship accordingly. It’s been six years now. She’s too good, too lovely. She’s a force of nature. I understood that almost immediately.&quot;
