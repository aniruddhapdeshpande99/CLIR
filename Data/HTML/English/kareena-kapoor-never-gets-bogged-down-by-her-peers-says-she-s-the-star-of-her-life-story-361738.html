Kareena Kapoor Never Gets Bogged Down By Her Peers, Feels She's The Star Of Her Life Story
It's safe to say that Kareena Kapoor is one of a kind Bollywood actress. Whether it's her movie choices, her quirky comebacks, her sense of fashion, work out routine or just her good looks, Bebo has all the ingredients of an ideal heroine.
But just when we think she's great on-screen, Kareena surprises us with her antics off-screen as well. Her whole pregnancy and the fabulous appearances were goals to many mom-to-be's and to all of us. In fact, because of her, Taimur has also become the most wanted kid for the paparazzi.

Unlike other A-listers who hide the faces of their kids, Kareena is one confident mother and loves the fact that the photographers love her child so much. Speaking to a leading news agency, Kareena spoke about how she's secure about the way she lives her life.
&quot;The fact that I am aware about my strengths, makes me secure. I am never looking at what others are doing, which films they are choosing, the directors or actors they are working with. All these things never bothered me. I am the star of my life story. Nobody else can dictate my choices,&quot; Kareena told PTI in an interview.

And rightly so, Veere Di Wedding was about 4 imperfect girls trying to make a perfect life. It was Kareena's comeback film and she nailed it with her acting and box office numbers proving there's nothing like a comeback.
&quot;As a person, I am very comfortable in my space. I have always been content with the choices I made in my career as well as my personal life. I was never aspiring to be someone. I was always working and will keep working towards being the better version of me&quot;, she added.
Kareena dipped toes in the world of Bollywood at the age of 17 and since then she hasn't looked back. Thanks to her filmy family background, she realised it was important to be secure to be a good artiste.
&quot;Otherwise, you won't be able to do justice to your character. And to be secure, one needs to focus on their work and career graph rather than constantly look at what others are doing.&quot;
