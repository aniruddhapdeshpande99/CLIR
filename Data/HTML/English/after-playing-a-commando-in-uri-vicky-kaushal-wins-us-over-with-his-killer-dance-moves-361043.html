From blending in with supporting roles such as Sanjay Dutt’s best friend Kamli in Sanju to playing solo lead as Indian commando in Uri, Vicky Kaushal has formed a league of his own, just like his contemporaries – Irrfan Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Rajkummar Rao among others.
After impressing us all and making more fans than ever before in Uri: The Surgical Strike, he is now the crush of many women. To make you go weak in your knees, a video of him rehearsing for a dance performance is doing the rounds. And boy, his energy and grace will bowl you over. Take a look!
Wondering what is he practicing for? He is gearing up for his performance at the annual police show Umang 2019. The event will apparently witness the presence of a range of Bollywood stars. Last year, Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh made headlines with their performances at the event. We are sure Vicky Kaushal will steal the show too!
