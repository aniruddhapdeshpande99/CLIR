This Mash-Up Of Ranveer Singh’s Gully Boy & Eminem’s 8 Mile Will Make You Want To See Them Rap Together
It hasn’t happened in a very long time that a Bollywood movie trailer sent the entire nation into a frenzy. From the film fraternity to Bollywood buffs, people couldn’t stop raving about Gully Boy on social media, where it seemingly brought in a storm of praises. Not just the dialogues and Ranveer Singh’s amazing Asli hip hop rap, every frame of the trailer stole the hearts of the people.
Kya trailer hai bc!!! I got goosebumps, tears, adrenaline rush, probably a mini orgasm too. All at once. Kudos https://t.co/MQtmdDUN23 — Ayushmann Khurrana (@ayushmannk) January 9, 2019
One thing that people noticed soon after the trailer of Ranveer Singh’s Gully Boy was released, was its uncanny resemblance to 2002 film 8 Mile. A lot of fans were instantly reminded of the Eminem-starrer film, which was loosely based on his life story, upbringing and rise to fame. A boy from poor family faces intense hardships as he wins against the odds making it big in the unknown world of hip hop – that’s what pretty much summarises the story of both the films, don’t you agree?
Now, a Facebook page called Indian Rap Memes has quite remarkably superimposed some clips from 8 Mile on Gully Boy’s trailer to make a mashup. The similarities between the two are astonishing. Take a look!
Starring Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt and Kalki Koechlin, Zoya Akhtar’s Gully Boy is slated to hit the screens on Feb 14.
