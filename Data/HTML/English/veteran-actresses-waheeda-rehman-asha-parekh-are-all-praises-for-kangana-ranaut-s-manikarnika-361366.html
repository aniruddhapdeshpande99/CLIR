And this time around, during the release of her film Manikarnika, more troubles came through. The director of the film left mid way, Sonu Sood declined the movie and she took charge of the movie on her shoulders.

The movie released to great box office numbers and has been doing really well. While many filmmakers are putting allegations on her for harassing them and over-powering them, but her performance on the silver screen is proving otherwise.

Asha Parekh too added, &quot;She has done a lot of hard work for the film and she has done a really nice job. She looks exactly like the Rani of Jhansi, regal in every aspect. I hope the film runs for a very long time.&quot;
