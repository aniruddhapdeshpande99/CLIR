After 9 Years, Akshay Kumar & Katrina Kaif Are Back With Their Irresistible Chemistry In Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi
Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif simply are one of the hit onscreen couples of the 2000s. There have been fireworks on the big screen each time they have come together. From films like Singh Is Kinng, Humko Deewana Kar Gaye to Namaste London, Tees Maar Khan, Welcome and De Dana Dan, each time the duo has appeared, they have created magic.
And now, after nine years, they reuniting on the big screen in a Rohit Shetty movie titled Sooryavanshi and fans are skittering away in excitement.
The film will reportedly have cameos by Ajay Devgn (Bajirao Singham) and Ranveer Singh (Simmba). So, it’s going to be Katrina’s first film with Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh. That’s interesting, right?

After Akshay-Katrina romancing in Namaste London’s Yahi Hota Pyaar to them both dancing in Singh Is Kinng’s Teri Ore and their crackling chemistry in Tees Maar Khan’s Sheila Ki Jawani, heir candour and honest performances have caught our fancies always.
Now, fans just can’t wait for Sooryavanshi.
