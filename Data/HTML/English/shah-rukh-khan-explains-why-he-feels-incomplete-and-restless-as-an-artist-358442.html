&quot;I have never felt complete. As an artist, I am very incomplete and I know that. If I am not, then I would not like to work. If I am complete then why would I wake up in the morning and work hard and still try to do something?.&quot;
Khan further added that being restless is his nature. He adds,
Agencies
&quot;I always think, within the commercial cinema set-up that I am working in, how can I bring in something new, as an actor, as a producer, in whatever capacity I can. I am not complete at all, I am very restless. If you think you are complete, then you are boring, over and done with!&quot;
He further explains that the issue with looking at things in life as a finish line, according to Shah Rukh, is what does one do when they cross it. He adds,
Don't Miss 343 SHARES 555 SHARES 263 SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES
&quot;So I don't think of things as completing. As an old saying goes...the journey is important. If I cross anything, which I think is a good achievement then I don't think of it as an end-line, I think of it as a milestone. But I don't plan for it. I don't think of 'I should earn this much', or 'I should have that many awards', or 'I have to make that many hit films', I think it is very organic. Because, if you worked in films as long as I have, specifics become less important....&quot;
He adds that he is doing films but he never expects anything after it. He adds,
&quot;After twenty-five years of working, I have realised that the only reason you should be working is for the happiness of your heart.&quot;
His upcoming film Zero, directed by Aanand L Rai, aims to celebrate the incompleteness of people. In the film, Shah Rukh plays a vertically challenged man while Anushka Sharma features as a scientist with cerebral palsy and Katrina Kaif plays an actor who is emotionally incomplete.
Shah Rukh clarifies that none of the characters of the film are asking the viewers for pity or sympathy. He adds,
&quot;When films are made on special abilities, normally there is an attempt to gain sympathy. In the entire film, we have tried that all the three characters never ask for sympathy from the audience or the world. We don't want anyone's sympathy or empathy.&quot;
Further, he talks about the challenges of playing a vertically challenged person. He says that in no way was this a gimmick for him. He concludes by saying,
&quot;For the last one year, we have been worried that the character's height shouldn't become the mainstay of the film. In the first ten-fifteen minutes and even after the trailer, you overcome that. That doesn't become a gimmick. Aanand and I didn't want that to happen.&quot;
Starring Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif, Zero is scheduled to be released on December 21.
