According to news reports, close to 200,000 bees inhabiting hives in Notre-Dame cathedral survived the inferno that engulfed the heritage landmark in a miraculous escape, their beekeeper said Thursday.
&quot;The bees are alive. Until this morning, I had had no news,&quot; said beekeeper Nicolas Geant who looks after the hives which are kept on top of a sacristy that adjoins the cathedral.
Talking AFP, Geant said,
&quot;At first I thought that the three hives had burned but I had no information. Then I saw from satellite images that this was not the case and then the cathedral spokesman told me that they were going in and out of the hives.&quot;

Colony Collapse Disorder?
According to United States Environmental Protection Agency, &quot;Colony Collapse Disorder is the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees and the queen. Once thought to pose a major long term threat to bees, reported cases of CCD have declined substantially over the last five years.&quot;
For those who don't know, It has become increasingly customary in the French capital for bee hives to be introduced at seemingly unlikely locations, including also at the Paris Opera.
