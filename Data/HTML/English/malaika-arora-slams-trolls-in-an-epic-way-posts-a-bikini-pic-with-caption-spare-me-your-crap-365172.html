Malaika Arora Slams Trolls In An Epic Way, Posts A Bikini Pic With Caption ‘Spare Me Your Crap’
From her bikini pictures to her relationship with Arjun Kapoor, Malaika Arora has been often trolled for various reasons on social media. We might envy celebs for the glamorous life they live, but not many of them have been spared from trolls. Malaika Arora Khan’s recent post seems to be a classy response to the trolls.
Slamming the haters, Malaika Arora posted a backless bikini picture, which appears to be from her last vacation to Maldives. With a million dollar smile and wink, Malaika posted a kickass response to the trolls.
&ldquo;Being happy is a choice and I choose to be happy... also I think happiness looks good on me... so, keep your opinions and your negativity to yourself and spare me your c**p.&quot; She also added these hashtags to her caption: &quot;#notinterested&quot;, &quot;#toobusybeinghappy,&rdquo; she wrote.
Of late, Malaika Arora has been on the receiving end of the troll comments on her posts, majorly because of her alleged relationship with Arjun Kapoor. It is said that she was holidaying in Maldives along with Arjun Kapoor.

Talking about her divorce with Arbaaz Khan, Malaika had earlier said that she got the freedom to move and make new choices.
&ldquo;Divorce is a huge step. It gave me freedom in the sense that I could make a choice that I stand by.
It is a choice that is not applauded by many but it gives you the freedom to move on, to make new choices, to go ahead in the world with your head held high and without feeling the past baggage,&rdquo; she was quoted as saying by Film Companion.
If rumours are to be believed, Malaika and Arjun have been dating each other for quite some time now. Although, they have not confirmed their relationship as of yet, grapevine suggests that they might tie the knot soon.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
