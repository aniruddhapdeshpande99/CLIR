The viewers are damn interested to watch the Kapoor siblings on the show as there might be a lot of revelation from Sonam’s crazy wedding party.
That's not all, we will also see Baahubali trio, Prabhas, Rana Daggubatti and SS Rajamouli gracing the show for the first time. As per reports in Midday, Prabhas who is camera shy has given his nod to be on the show. Isn’t it damn exciting?

A close source of publication quoted, &ldquo;Given that they are the minds behind the biggest Indian film and have gained pan-India popularity, KJo wanted them to feature on the show. Prabhas, who is otherwise media-shy, agreed to make an appearance only as a mark of his respect for Karan. The episode will be shot later this month. Prabhas, Rana and Rajamouli will trace the journey of Baahubali while revealing several interesting nuggets that the audience may not be aware of.&rdquo;
This year on Karan’s Koffee show, we saw and will see many new faces making their first appearance, right from Sara Ali Khan, Janhvi Kapoor, Diljit Dosanjh, Ishaan Khatter, Baadshah, Shweta Bachchan and lot more.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
