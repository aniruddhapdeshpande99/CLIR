At a recent event in Mumbai, Deepika was asked about Ranveer’s magnificent energy that he has, to which she replied,
&ldquo;I don’t know what happens when he leaves the house as he’s an extremely different person which I think people will also start seeing. Like if you see him in his work mode, which is that, there’s an extremely quiet side to him, there’s an extremely intelligent side to him, there’s a very sensitive and emotional side to him, there’s a vulnerable childlike innocence, so there are so many facets to him&rdquo;.
The wifey is all praises for her hubby.
She even joked that she doesn’t mix anything in his coconut water which he has every morning. These two are just LOVE.
