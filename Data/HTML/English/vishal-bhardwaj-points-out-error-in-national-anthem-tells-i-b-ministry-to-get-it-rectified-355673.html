Complaining about the same and urging I&B ministry to rectify it, here’s what he posted on Twitter.
Heard our national anthem produced by @Films_Division and @MIB_India during @MumbaiFilmFest. There is a technical glitch at &quot;Gahe Tav Jai Gaatha&quot;, seems to be a sound transfer issue. Goes off tune and hurts ear and soul. Can @MIB_India please get this rectified? — Vishal Bhardwaj (@VishalBhardwaj) October 29, 2018
Vishal Bhardwaj is basking in the success of Pataakha starring Sanya Malhotra and Radhika Madan. He will soon come up with a crime thriller titled Sapna Didi, which will star Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan. However, the movie is halted because of Irrfan Khan’s health condition. Recently, Vishal Bhardwaj said that he will most probably start with the shoot of the movie next year.
