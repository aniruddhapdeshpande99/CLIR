The fan has been identified as Salim, aged 35. He was apparently shattered after he couldn’t even catch a glimpse of the King of Romance, and so he slit his throat outside the superstar’s house.
Thereafter, he was taken to Bhabha Hospital where he was treated and let off, reports ANI.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
