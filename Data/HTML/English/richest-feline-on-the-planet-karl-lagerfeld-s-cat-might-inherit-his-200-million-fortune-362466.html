Just in case you didn’t know, Choupette has 175,000 followers on social media. Unlike other cats, she eats at a table. &ldquo;She is like a human being, only with an extra quality - silence,&rdquo; Lagerfeld had quipped.
&ldquo;Choupette is the centre of my world,&rdquo; he had once admitted. She has never done advertisements for cat food. Why? Because &ldquo;She is too sophisticated for that,&rdquo; he had said.
The pampered eight-year-old cat was &ldquo;kidnapped&rdquo; by Karl Lagerfeld in 2011 from his young friend and male model Baptiste Giabiconi. She could just be about to inherit a slice of his estimated $200-million (176-million-euro) fortune.
