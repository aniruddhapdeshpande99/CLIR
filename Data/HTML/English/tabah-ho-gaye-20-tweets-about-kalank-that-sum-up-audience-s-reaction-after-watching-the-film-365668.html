Starring Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Aditya Roy Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha and Kunal Khemu, the film was being touted as one of the most anticipated releases of the year, but did it manage to live up to all the expectations that they tried to target with their endless film promotions?
