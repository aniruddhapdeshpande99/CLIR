&quot;That's a wrap for the India portion of our shoot, next stop Thailand. Can't say enough how grateful we are to the people of India for letting us run riot through the streets while shooting what I think could be some of the most intense and exciting action sequences ever done. Our director Sam Hargrave is bringing it to a whole new level. Netflix. India,&quot; Hemsworth posted on Instagram on Saturday.
His emotional goodbye note was accompanied by a video in which he is in the midst of a huge crowd near a flyover, and people are cheering for him.
The actor, who famously plays Thor, was earlier shooting for Dhaka in Ahmedabad, where he was overwhelmed to see cars, auto-rickshaws, and bikes crisscrossed in a traffic jam -- a scene he described as a &quot;beautiful chaos&quot;.
It has been an action-packed schedule for Hemsworth. Badri ki Dulhania singer Rajnigandha Shekhawat, a Hemsworth fan, managed to meet the actor in Ahmedabad. Sharing her experience, Rajnigandha told IANS,

&quot;I went with the sole intention of meeting him and divine intervention helped me achieve it. He was shooting from morning 6 a.m. till 6 p.m. in the Ahmedabad sun. While all others had their pollution masks on, he shot without it in the sweltering heat and returned super exhausted, daily. Aside from his 20 minute high intensity workout, he never left his room. The few moments that I got with him, he was very polite and courteous, heard what I said, thanked me for a package I gave him, and was an overall nice guy.&quot;
Hemsworth, through his social media posts, has expressed gratitude more than once for the kindness and generosity that the people of India have extended to the team of Dhaka. He started shooting for Dhaka on November 3 and shared some glimpses from on and off the sets with his Instagram followers.
Dhaka is reportedly an action film in which the actor plays a character that has to liberate a kidnapped Indian boy. Physically brave but an emotional coward, the man has to come to terms with his identity and sense of self.
