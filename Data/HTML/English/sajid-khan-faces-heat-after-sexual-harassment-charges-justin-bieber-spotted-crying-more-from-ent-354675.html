Sajid has not personally addressed the issues one by one but has stepped down as the director of Housefull 4. He further says that this in no ways means he admits the charges but has left the mid way as there is immense amount of pressure on his family.
Speaking to a leading channel, The Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hai actress said,
&ldquo;It's rubbish. You have to take a call that time only, it's simple. You should speak about that matter that time only. Even I got a lesson.
