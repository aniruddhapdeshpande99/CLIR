Ahead of Game Of Thrones season 8, when Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams appeared on American television show Access for an interview, they also attempted Priyanka Chopra’s dance moves that Sophie learnt at the wedding in Jodhpur’s Umaid Bhawan in Dec 2018.
Of course, Sophie was asked about the grand wedding that made headlines all over the world. &ldquo;Is there going to be a big dance number to compete with Priyanka and Nick (at your wedding)?&rdquo; Sophie was asked. To which, she replied by demonstrating the only move she remembered. Maisie William joined in soon.

&ldquo;No dance numbers. The thing is, Priyanka’s family are in the entertainment industry and they can dance and sing, and Joe’s family obviously can and my family are not. My brother’s a doctor, my other brother’s a lawyer,&rdquo; she said shaking her head at the possibility of them dancing at the wedding.
But you were so good, Sophie Turner! Meanwhile, watch Sophie Turner dancing to Kareena Kapoor’s Tareefan below.
