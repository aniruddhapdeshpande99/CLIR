But did you know Raavan was first offered to Shah Rukh Khan and not Abhishek Bachchan, but he declined the movie? &ldquo;I enjoyed working with Mani Ratnam. It was fun. He wanted me to do Raavan.

Recently, Shah Rukh Khan has reportedly declined to star in the Rakesh Sharma biopic, which was first offered to Aamir Khan. It is said that Shah Rukh doesn’t want to experiment and take a risk, especially after the failure of Zero. Meanwhile, he will reprise the role of a gangster in Don 3, which is tentatively titled Don: The Final Chapter.
Do you think the fate of Raavan would have changed had Shah Rukh Khan and not Abhishek Bachchan starred in it?
