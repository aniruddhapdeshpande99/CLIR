Did You Know, Shah Rukh Khan Thought Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’s Script Was Utterly Nonsense At First?
Rahul, who strongly believed that &ldquo;Hum ek baar jeete hai, ek baar marte hai, shaadi bhi ek baar hoti hai ... aur pyar ek baar hi hota hai&rdquo; did actually fall in love and marry twice in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Ironic much?
20 years after the release of the movie, Karan Johar accepts that Rahul, played by Shah Rukh Khan, in his debut film was a bit of a &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; and that Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has some flaws.

Celebrating 20 years of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’s release, Shah Rukh Khan quipped how he still hasn’t understood the script of the movie.
&ldquo;I never listen to scripts, I listen to the heartbeats of the people I work with at times millennial chat with me and say things like why you let go of that script that was such a great script. Till date, I never understood a script. And I can say this with confidence that I never understood the script but the script maker or the filmmaker,&rdquo; he told IANS.

&ldquo;Karan came and narrated an utterly nonsense crap story to me; which is certainly not the one that finally you people saw in the film. In his strange way Karan, the man with many words tried to impress me with his crap story. So yes, I really did not understand the story when I signed in. and I am glad that I did not get into the story and just went ahead with the conviction of Karan, otherwise the film would have not been the way it came out,&rdquo; he added.
