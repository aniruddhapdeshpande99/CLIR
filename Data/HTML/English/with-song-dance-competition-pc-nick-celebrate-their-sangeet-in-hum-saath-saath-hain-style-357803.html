Giving us a glimpse into the Sangeet ceremony, Priyanka Chopra finally treated fans with the pictures. Here's all that went inside the Umaid Bhawan!
In a typical desi style, a song and dance competition was held between the two families. All the guests and family members were dressed up in desi attires. With each song, they told a story, much like Hum Saath Saath Hain maybe?! Who won and who was the judge, well that hasn't been revealed.
Priyanka Chopra danced with mother as well.
