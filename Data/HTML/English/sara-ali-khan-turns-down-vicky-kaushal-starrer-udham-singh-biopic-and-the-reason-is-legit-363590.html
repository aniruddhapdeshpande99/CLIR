She is currently shooting for Imtiaz Ali's Love Aaj Kal 2 with Kartik Aaryan and apparently, her dates were also clashing with Udham Singh and that's another reason why she turned it down.
The film is all set to go on the floors in April and will release in 2020.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
