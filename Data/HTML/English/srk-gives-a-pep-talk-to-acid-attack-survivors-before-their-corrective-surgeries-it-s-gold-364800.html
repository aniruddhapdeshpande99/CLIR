&quot;The main idea is to believe the fact that you will do something for yourself. If you have the intent everything else will follow. For every one of us, it's important to ensure we work for ourselves. We should do our own work without depending on anyone else. Even if it's a small job we should do it to fend for ourselves. And at the end of the day, we must be independent. In my heart, this is like a family. All of you are like my own people. I don't know much about each of you, because everyone has their personal lives and I don't want to get into those details. The main thing is to believe we can be independent. I'll be in touch with the doctors and get regular updates. We will try and get the best people to work with us.&rdquo;
