In an interview with Deccan Chronicle, Ranveer compared K3G and Takht and explained that the two films are have different dynamics but the crux of both the films is same.
&ldquo;People don’t understand that K3G is a family film and it’s about internal dynamics of family and Takht is the same at its core. What period it’s set in? And what costumes they are wearing? The world is just a decoration.
At the core, it’s a family drama about love, greed, ambition, betrayal, brotherhood, and dynamics between father, son, brothers, and sisters; all this compiles the essence of the story&rdquo;.
