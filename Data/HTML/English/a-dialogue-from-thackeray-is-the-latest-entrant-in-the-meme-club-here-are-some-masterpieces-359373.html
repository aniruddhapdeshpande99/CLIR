A Dialogue From â€˜Thackerayâ€™ Is The Latest Entrant In The Meme Club & Here Are Some Masterpieces
Yesterday, the trailer of much-awaited biopic Thackeray, which is based on the life of Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray had released, and since then social media has been buzzing with posts around it.
Nawazuddin Siddiquiâ€™s uncannily similar look to the Shiv Sena chief and an impeccable goose-bumps inducing performance has struck a chord with the audiences.
Soon after the release of the trailer, CBFC raised objections to four dialogues and two scenes in the movie, and asked the makers to make necessary changes. Furthermore, actor Siddharth also called out the movie trailer for being &ldquo;anti-South Indian&rdquo;.
