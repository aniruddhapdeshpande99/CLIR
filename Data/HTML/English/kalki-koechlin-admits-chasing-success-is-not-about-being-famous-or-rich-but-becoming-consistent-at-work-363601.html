Kalki has been balancing her choice of scripts exceptionally well. After playing a small yet powerful role in Gully Boy, she has made her smashing entry yet again in Made In Heaven, the web series, which has got everyone talking due to its powerful content.

In the 9 episodic show, Kalki plays a prominent role unleashing a grey character who is in love with her best friend's husband. Indiatimes got talking to her after the success of Made In Heaven and she looked totally different from Faiza, her character when we met her.

Donning a hippy look, with front bangs on a boyish haircut, Kalki can make any look rock.

We asked her on what basis she chooses her script, to which Kalki said, &ldquo;In your life, you choose scripts at different times and for different reasons. Of course, there is a sort of gut and instinct that excites you, but sometimes you do a character because it is so different from what you have done before and it kind of challenges you. Other times it’s the platform, you know these are the writers and directors that you can really trust, it’s just something which challenges you, sometimes you get bored of doing the same thing, so it’s never the same reason. There is never one magical reason on why you do some role, it’s a combination of what’ s happening in your life.&rdquo;

Kalki shares a great camaraderie with Zoya Akhtar especially after Gully Boy. When asked if she will blindly say yes to her films considering the success rate and Kali said, &ldquo;Blindly, maybe not. But for instance, when I read Made In Heaven, I didn’t read the entire season, I just read Faiza’s part and I knew Zoya is making a good story. She is a strong writer and director so of course, in that sense, there are certain people you do trust. &ldquo;
Talking about how emotionally draining Faiza’s character was, Kalki says, &ldquo;I was miserable playing Faiza because it’s a roller coaster that’s she is going on. I was very tired at that point of my life so I used to come tired on the sets only but, of course now when I look back, I am happy because she is such a powerful character, I love the scenes where she is going to the therapist and the truth come out from those scenes.&quot;
Twitter
We asked Kalki how does she switch herself from one character to another or if she finds it a difficult or smooth process for her, Kalki answered, &ldquo;Most of the prep happens when you are reading the script. We do readings with our directors and ask them several questions about it, plus you get into styling the character, there is a certain habit that they have, so we form all that beforehand. Of course, some of the characters are much more challenging like Margarita With A Straw was very challenging because playing someone with that disability is so different from my normal day to day life, so that took a lot of time for me to get into that character. Also, I just imagine a day in that person’s life and things become easy.&quot;

Sipping her coconut water in a Mason jar, she answered our next question about the size of her role, &ldquo;Of course, there is crying sometimes, you wish you had a bigger part, but at the same time I am busy with so many things. I am blessed enough to continue doing other work, and even if I don’t have other work, I pick up the script and direct it for theaters. I am not the kind of person who can wait for six months for something to happen. I don’t work like that both from financial and mental perspective. I need to keep working for those two things and so I do.&rdquo;
Twitter
We asked Kalki if she is chasing success and she said,
&ldquo;I chase success but success for me is different from just like being the most famous or the richest girl, that’s not success. Success is consistency in my work, trying to keep doing content, being relevant, these are ideas of success for me and in that sense I do believe in success, but it’s not the conventional idea.&rdquo;
Made In Heaven has Arjun Mathur who plays a homosexual in the web series and has won accolades for his performance for his role. It has a lot of intimate scenes of Arjun with another man and it’s quite liberating to see unlike Bollywood which is known for its stereotypical projection.
We asked Kalki if Bollywood is to blame for gays not getting an equal respect in the society, to which she said, &ldquo;Blaming Bollywood for society’s problem is like blaming a mirror for reflecting. I mean, art will reflect what society does, what we consume as audience is what will be there most, if we keep watching these stereotypical movies if we keep putting money there, so the makers will invest most of the money there, and now if you want to change that you need to know your content better, you need to choose what you consume, it is that simple. Decide what do you want to watch and put money there, make an effort to see that film that’s the alternative film, Sonchiraiya right now is an alternative story which is a strong film but the screens are empty, I went the other day, so who are choosing to watch this is us, it’s the society.&rdquo;
Before wrapping up the interview, we told Kalki to keep doing such experimental roles and she said, &ldquo;I promise, I will as I have to pay my home loan too&rdquo;. Clearly the woman has set all her goals right.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
