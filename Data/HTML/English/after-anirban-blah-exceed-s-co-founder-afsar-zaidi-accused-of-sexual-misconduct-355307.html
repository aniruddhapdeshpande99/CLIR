According to a report in Mid Day, Afsar Zaidi, co-founder of Exceeds Entertainment has been accused by two survivors who wished to remain anonymous.
Recalling the horrific experience, one of the survivors, who joined the celebrity management company in 2014, reportedly told Mid Day that Afsar Zaidi had asked her strange questions during the interview which she did not pay heed to then. She also recalled Zaidi commenting on her dressing sense quite frequently, positively though.
It was only when she went on a month-long official international trip that she reportedly got the first blow. They had cracked a big deal with a celebrity and a major TV channel for a reality show.

She revealed to Mid Day how she was asked by her CEO to keep Ajit Thakur happy on the trip. She also confessed that she did not know what &ldquo;keeping happy&rdquo; meant at that time. She soon realised it when she was reportedly asked to help Ajit Thakur get women at a party.

On expressing her discomfort in doing so, she was reportedly said, ‘Ye sab karna padta hai’ (You have to do such things).
Ajit, according to the report, continued the 'after party' in her CEO's room where he repeatedly came onto to her. Although she made an excuse to leave a little later, she was followed to the beach by him where he got relentless. She remembered making her unavailability clear and going back to her room.
She also recalled an office party, held in the city a few months later, where she was sexually harassed by Afsar Zaidi in a drunken state. She told Mid Day that Afsar was physically grabbing people and pouring drinks down their throats.

Although she initially succeeded in dodging him, at one point, he grabbed her from behind, put his hands on my breast and forced her to down a drink. Later, after sometime he came to her again and started rubbing his penis up against her back.
There were reportedly about 30 people around but nobody came to her rescue. She remembered pushing him away with her elbow. According to her, he was so drunk that he tried to take advantage of another employee that evening.
The other survivor also told Mid Day that the 2014 incident was a &ldquo;near rape&rdquo; incident and said it was horrific how no one from the firm stoop up for her then.
Meanwhile, Afsar Zaidi, on the other hand, has reportedly denied all the allegations levelled against him. He said that the allegations that appear to have been made are without basis, and are an attempt to malign and defame his reputation and that of the company.

The company has in place a policy for sexual harassment at the workplace. If the complainant has a genuine case, he asked her to come forward and present it before the ICC constituted by the firm.
He also added that he denies all the allegations in entirety, they have been made without any basis or an iota of evidence. According to the reports, he now plans to take appropriate legal action.
