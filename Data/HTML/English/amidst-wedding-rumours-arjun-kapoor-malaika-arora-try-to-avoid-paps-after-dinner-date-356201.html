&ldquo;Malaika and Arjun are extremely fond of each other. They have never really spoken about each other but they are extremely happy in their own personal space. In a steady relationship now, Malaika and Arjun plan to take their relationship to next level and tie the knot next year.&quot;
The couple has managed to get into the spotlight after paps clicked them exiting from a cafe in Bandra. Whether it was a date or not, it's difficult to decode but the way Arjun shielded Malaika from the photographers and the crowd was indeed chivalrous and sweet! Have a look at the pictures.
