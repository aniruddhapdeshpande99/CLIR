Shah Rukh Khan’s Zero Falls Flat At The Box Office & Fans Are Roasting It With Memes And Jokes
The King of Bollywood has failed to impress his fans yet again. After Harry Met Sejal, SRK’s Zero is facing the heat of the audiences.
Before the release, people wondered if Zero will be another flop like Thugs Of Hindostan or a superhit like 2.0. But Aanand L Rai’s romantic comedy failed to strike the right chord with the audiences.
Despite good promotional strategies that included his character Bauua Singh popping out from different forms of media, Shah Rukh Khan’s new-age film turned out to be a disaster for most of the people. The movie opened quite well at the box office (Rs 20 crore), but on the second day (Rs 16 crore) itself, the collections started to dip.
Even Shah Rukh Khan fans are disappointed. Take a look!

First half of #zero deserves 3.5 stars and second half deserves -3.5 stars.
