That was the beginning of her heath struggles which led to two life-threatening brain aneurysms.
In an essay written for The New Yorker, Emilia Clarke says she thought she would die. &quot;In my worst moments, I wanted to pull the plug. I asked the medical staff to let me die,&quot; she said.
What had happened to her? Doctors diagnosed her with having a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), from which a third of sufferers die immediately or soon after. After the surgery, a condition called aphasia set in, meaning she could not communicate and feared her acting career was over.
When after the first surgery, she was warned about second smaller aneurysm on the other side of her brain, she could see her life ahead, &ldquo;and it wasn’t worth living,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am an actor; I need to remember my lines. Now I couldn’t recall my name.&rdquo;

It was in 2013, while performing for a play in New York, she received brain surgery for a second aneurysm on the other side of her brain. This second surgery was gruesome as her skull was opened up for it. &ldquo;I looked as though I had been through a war more gruesome than any Daenerys experienced.&rdquo;

She had recovered post the surgery and had even begun shooting for season 2, but she was feeling very weak, and that is when she thought she would die. &ldquo;Season 2 would be my worst. I didn’t know what Daenerys was doing. If I am truly being honest, every minute of every day I thought I was going to die.&rdquo;

She says she is now &quot;at a hundred per cent&quot; and has helped develop a charity that supports people recovering from brain injuries and strokes.
