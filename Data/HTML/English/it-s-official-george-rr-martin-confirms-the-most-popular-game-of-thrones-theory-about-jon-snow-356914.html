Meanwhile, there are a lot of questions in the minds of ardent Game of Thrones fans. Who will sit on the Iron Throne? Will the Night King be killed? Who will survive and who will die?
Well, George RR Martin knows it all, and he has just confirmed a popular Game of Thrones theory doing the rounds.
Remember that The Red Witch, Melissandre, had revealed about Azor Ahai – aka The Prince That Was Promised – as a chosen warrior who brought an end to the conflict when he destroyed the Great Others (basically the White Walkers) with his burning sword, the Lightbringer?

George RR Martin has now confirmed that Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) is Azor Ahai, the legendary hero, who has reborn to save the world yet again.
&quot;Aegon finally decided to take over Westeros and unify the Seven Kingdoms that existed at the time under one rule. There is a lot of speculation that in some sense he saw what was coming 300 years later, and wanted to unify the Seven Kingdoms to be better prepared for the threat that he eventually saw coming from the north — the threat that we are dealing with in A Song of Ice and Fire,&rdquo; Matin says in the video, clearly stating that Aegon knew that hundreds of years later, the White Walkers would rise again, which also hints Aegon is Azor Ahai.
So that means Jon Snow will kill the White Walkers, right?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
