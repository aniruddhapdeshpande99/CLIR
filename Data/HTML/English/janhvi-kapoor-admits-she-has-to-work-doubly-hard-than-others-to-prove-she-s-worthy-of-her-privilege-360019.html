&ldquo;The whole nepotism debate (when I was making my debut in Dhadak) did make me question if I deserved to be in this position and I realized that the right answer to it is that I’m not. I do come from a place of privilege. But I have it, so what am I supposed to do now? I’d be the dumbest person on the planet if I didn’t do anything about it. So I need to ensure that I make the best of it and push myself to work as hard as I can...only then can I justify that I’m worthy.&quot;
While the airport and gym look of celebrities trend on the internet all the time, it's not a very delightful experience for the stars. Janhvi added,

&quot;It's a price that all of us have to pay. I think it's so flattering that people would even give me enough attention to know about my private life. I can't crib about it, I am not in that position. Plus, people wanting to know about you also comes from a place of love. So you just have to balance it; it's your responsibility. And honestly, I want this too much to complain about anything.&quot;
On the work front, Janhvi has reportedly signed a biopic of Gunjan Saxena, who is one of India’s first women combat aviators.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
