Nick Jonas Brother Joe Welcomes Priyanka Chopra Into The Family In The Sweetest Way Possible
Priyanka Chopra made her dreams come true on her terms and conditions and that is why this lady is an inspiration to all. She is a dreamer, achiever and we love her. Priyanka’s marriage with her Prince Charming Nick Jonas was one fairytale affair and everything about her wedding was dreamy and gorgeous.
After PC and Nick’s grand wedding, her brother in law welcomed her into the sweetest way possible. Joe Jonas shared a beautiful picture of Priyanka and Nick on Instagram and wrote, &ldquo; Super Married! I Love You Both! Welcome to the Family Pri! Congratulations! My face hurts from all the smiling this week.&rdquo;
Joe refers to Priyanka as Pri and we find it adorable. Talking about the dreamy wedding in Today’s Show Joe said, &ldquo;Marrying Nick off to Priyanka has just been fantastic. Obviously, this has been one of the most beautiful weddings I’ve ever seen and to be part of it was a dream. I was just overwhelmed with emotion. This is my brother, my best friend and to see him marrying his dream girl ... there was a lot of tears the whole weekend — and a lot of smiles.&rdquo;

Infact, Joe even slammed an entertainment portal for calling PC a global scam artist.
This is disgusting. @TheCut should be ashamed to have someone write such evil words. What Nick & Pri have is Beautiful Love. Thank u, Next. https://t.co/G3hvXmhm9O — J O E J O N A S (@joejonas) December 5, 2018
