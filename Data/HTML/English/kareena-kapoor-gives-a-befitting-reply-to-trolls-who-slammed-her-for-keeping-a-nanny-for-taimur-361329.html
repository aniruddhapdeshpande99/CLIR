Kareena Kapoor Gives A Befitting Reply To Trolls Who Slammed Her For Keeping A Nanny For Taimur
Taimur Ali Khan was a born star. From the day his first picture went viral on social media to until yesterday when he was spotted on the sets of Sacred Games 2 with daddy Saif Ali Khan, his every picture makes headline.

Just like little munchkin Taimur, his nanny is a star too. She is often seen accompanying him almost everywhere he goes. But did you know that her salary is more than that of the prime minister of our nation. While the nanny’s salary is Rs. 1.75 lakhs depending on the extra hours she works, PM’s salary is 1.60 Lakh per month as revealed by an RTI filed in 2012.
If Taimur’s pictures are your guilty pleasure too, you would know that Kareena Kapoor is often trolled for keeping a nanny. And not only her, Shahid Kapoor’s wife Mira Rajput is also trolled for the same.

Recently, on her radio show, Kareena Kapoor opened up about people shaming celeb moms.
&ldquo;I have to address one thing… recently I got trolled on a photo where I was getting into a private jet… and the trolling was about how apparently, I’m a careless mother who’s letting my kid be brought up by nannies. To you judgemental folks who know nothing about my life, please note that there’s a finger I’m showing you in my mind right now.&rdquo;
