Talking about the menace of piracy, IFFI’s vice-president Ramesh Tekwani had told IANS, &ldquo;The government decision of including an anti-camcording provision in the Cinematography Act to control piracy will need serious implementation.&rdquo; He had added, &ldquo;Announcement is fine but people should be stopped from recording films by asking them to deposit their phones before entering theatres. One single phone can shoot the entire film. People also know different ways to record the film.&rdquo;
Gully Boy is a film about a 22-year-old boy &quot;Murad&quot; (Ranveer Singh) from the slums in Mumbai. Murad aka Ranveer feels he has the potential to be a rapper. Authentic Hip Hop in India is the latest fad and like any part in the world, rapping is rising from the streets and this movie shows Murad's journey to become one.
Internet has also called Gully Boy as one of the finest performances of Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh. The movie has so far collected Rs 70 crore and is expected to touch Rs 100 by the end of this week. Directed by Zoya Akhtar, the film will soon cross the lifetime collection of Dil Dhadakne Do and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
