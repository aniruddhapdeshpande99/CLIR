After all, she got married to the love of her life Ranveer Singh, and since then she is high on happiness. Also, her film Padmaavat in which she completely nailed the character of Rani Padmavati, was well-received by her fans and critics. What’s more? At Cannes 2018, she made a thunderous entry making several heads turn with her breathtakingly gorgeous look.
Deepika sure has seen ups and downs in her career – she succumbed to depression too – but she emerged a warrior, fought it all to prove that happy endings aren’t myths. After a failed relationship with Ranbir Kapoor that took a toll on her life, she is now happily married to Ranveer Singh.
The diva stole hearts from the day she ventured into the world of films. Remember when she walked out of a car wearing a pink lehenga waving at the crowd in her debut film Om Shaanti Om? She made several people swoon. She is a self-made independent woman, a style-queen too, and a charming personality that gives strength and love to those who walk into her life – like Ranveer Singh – who calls her his &ldquo;super-power&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hummingbird&rdquo; and the best decision of his life.
