They started with a bang but they will break our hearts when they go!
We know 12 seasons and 12 years is a long time, but these quirky physicists and their friends made a big place for themselves in our hearts, didn‚Äôt they?

This year marks the end of a lot of long-running shows. As if Game Of Thrones wasn‚Äôt enough, Suits and The Big Bang Theory is following suit!
Goodbyes are always hard and imagine saying it to the team that has been together for 12 long years. The final table read that took place last night was as emotional as it can get. So much so that Kaley Cuoco aka Penny had a breakdown of sorts.

For the uninitiated, a final table read means that the entire cast and crew huddle together and read the script of the last episode of a season before the filming but in this case it was the series!

It was obvious that unlike the previous seasons which held a promise to meet again for the next one, this one was exceptionally difficult. This huddle was all about tears, sweet anecdotes, hugs and lots of tissues. Literally!
The members of the cast took to their social media accounts to share pictures from the reading.
Penny first teased the fans with the last page of the final script which read ‚ÄòEnd Of Series‚Äô.
The actress then shared multiple photos which included one of herself holding on to the script for dear life with tears streaking down her face and another one of her script covered in tissues.
She wrote, &ldquo;Prepare yourselves ‚Ä¶ for a finale that has truly given me a loss for words ‚ù§Ô∏è Our whole universe ‚Ä¶. @bigbangtheory_cbs.&rdquo;
Johnny Galecki who plays Leonard also shared a photo of himself sitting on the stairs outside their iconic apartment looking sullen.

Melissa Rauch aka Bernadette and Mayim Bialik aka Amy arrived a little late to the party (post season three) but that doesn‚Äôt mean that goodbye was easy for them. Before the reading, Melissa shared a group photo of the cast and the crew. She captioned it as,
&ldquo;About to go into our table read for the series finale written by this group of geniuses ~ AKA: the heart and soul of @bigbangtheory_cbs üíó.People often ask what the secret is behind the success of the show‚Ä¶well, it‚Äôs no secret‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the sheer brilliance of these incredible minds. Love them all so very much.&rdquo;
She then posted another photo of them sharing a group hug. This hug has been a ritual for the team of The Big Bang Theory. She captioned it as,
&ldquo;Just because I haven‚Äôt flooded my face with enough tears during/after today‚Äôs final @bigbangtheory_cbs table read‚Ä¶here‚Äôs a pic of our pre-show huddle last night. I was always picked last for every team as a kid, so getting to be a part of a huddle ~ let alone this particular huddle has been extra special. I‚Äòll forever cherish these moments with my TBBT brothers and sisters.&rdquo;
It won‚Äôt be wrong to say that this year definitely marks the end of an era! I wish i could Bazinga you right now, tbh!
