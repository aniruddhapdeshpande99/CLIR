&ldquo;I’d been in several relationships before and many times my trust was broken. When I met Ranveer, I was exhausted. I’ve never casually dated anyone. I’ve been in relationships since I was13. Now that I’m married I can say this. Whether it was one year, two years or three years, they were always proper relationships. It was always if you like someone you give it your hundred percent,&rdquo; she told Filmfare.
