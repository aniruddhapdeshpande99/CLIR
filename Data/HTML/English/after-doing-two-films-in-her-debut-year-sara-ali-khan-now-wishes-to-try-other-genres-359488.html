&ldquo;I want to try each and every genre. Aisa koi genre nahi hai jo Sara nahi kar sakti. I need to do more work, I need to do better work, and I need to work harder. Because your battle keeps changing. And thatâ€™s life. Every time there are new challenges.&quot;
Talking about her future plans, she added,
&quot;I have worked very hard, I tried my level best with Kedarnath. I deserve 80% of the praise which I am getting. 20% is a combination of good karma and people genuinely liking me. Now I am going to work doubly hard. Right now you all like me as a person and I know that.&rdquo;
Currently, Sara and Ranveer Singh starrer Simmba is running in the theatres and the collections of the film look promising.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
