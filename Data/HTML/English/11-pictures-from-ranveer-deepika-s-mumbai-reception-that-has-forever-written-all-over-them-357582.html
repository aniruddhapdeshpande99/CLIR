Rather, they're inspirational human beings for reasons more than one. The couple solemnized their marriage in Italy this year and are in the celebratory mood to ensure that their beginning of forever is special in every possible way. The couple hosted their second reception in Mumbai last evening for their friends and fans from the media.
Before the party began, the couple posed for the media.

Like always, they couldn't keep their eyes off each other. From kissing DP's hands to whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears, the couple like always was way too adorable. Have a look at the pictures.
