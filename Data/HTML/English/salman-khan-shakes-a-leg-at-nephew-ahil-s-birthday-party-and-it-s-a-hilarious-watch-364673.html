Whether it's Bigg Boss finales or his birthday party, the actor is known to throw fancy parties at the Panvel farmhouse.
And this time too, Salman brought in nephew's birthday in the farmhouse in the most luxurious way. Ahil, Arpita and Aayush Sharma's son turned 3 yesterday and was seen having a gala time with his friends.
Salman Khan also made the evening an unforgettable one. He was seen grooving with a life size Donald Duck and even flossing the dance move. Wearing denim shorts and shirt along with a cowboy hat, the 52-year-old looked hilarious and totally in character.
