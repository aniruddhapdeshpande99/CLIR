Apart from designing restaurants and office spaces, Gauri has also designed the homes of Bollywood celebrities like Ranbir Kapoor, Varun Dhawan, Sidharth Malhotra, Karan Johar, and Jacqueline Fernandez among many others.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
