The show revolved around the relationships between six New Yorkers, Ross, Rachel, Monica (Courteney Cox), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc).
The show lasted for ten seasons but till today, the show manages to tickle our funny bone for all the right reasons. Apart from being a massive hit, the show made all six actors popular and yes, it isn't a secret that the show also turned them into multi-millionaires. It won't be wrong to say that the show entirely changed their fortune and for good!
But how were their inter-personal relationships on the sets? Well, if you are shooting for a show for ten years, you definitely need to have a rock-solid equation and bonding and that was definitely the case.
Keeping all media theories of their animosities aside, let's focus only on the parts that still make us laugh! Well, thanks to Instagram and several FRIENDS fans who are enthu-cutlets to an extent that they have a few accounts solely dedicated to the updates and bloopers from the iconic sitcom!
We came across one such unofficial account that has a lot of dope on our favorite TV show! We picked up a few bloopers that are unmissable and will teleport you to their world! Watch now.
