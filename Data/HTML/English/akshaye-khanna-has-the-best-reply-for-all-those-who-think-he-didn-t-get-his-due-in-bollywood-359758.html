Akshaye Khanna Has The Best Reply For All Those Who Think He Didn’t Get His Due In Bollywood
Akshaye Khanna is one of the best and versatile actors we have in the film industry. Till date he entertain us with different roles and outstanding acting skills. Once again, he is coming with a new film The Accidental Prime Minister where he plays the role of Sanjay Baru, a worker from Prime Minister Office under Manmohan Singh. This film is based on India’s former PM Manmohan Singh.

Indiatimes met Akshaye Khanna and spoke at length with him about the film, his life and everything between.
Firstly, we asked him about his preparations for Sanjay Baru in the film, to which he said, &ldquo;My prep was zero outside the realm of the script. The script was my preparation I just went by it, because my director was very clear. He didn’t want me to meet Sanjay Baru, he didn’t want me to see his videos, pictures, and not even an interaction and the reason behind is, he said, Akshaye I have to show Manmohan Singh as Manmohan Singh. I cannot play around with him, everybody knows how he walks, talks, it’s in our psyche, he was our Prime Minister for 10 years. Similarly, with all the real characters. He could only play around my character because Sanjay Baru is not a well-known character, nobody knows how he looks, he had his vision and I only went by it.&quot;

Later, we picked his brain on the controversy around the film, how the Congress party is against the film and doesn’t want them to release it, Akshaye said, &ldquo;We are only storytellers, I don’t actively follow politics. I have no interest in it, also one really never knows what to expect when something like this film is coming for the first time. India has not experienced a film like this, so these are uncharted territories, and we should stop predicting and rather watch the film, we are just going with the flow.&rdquo;

Akshaye Khanna who has been entertaining us since past two decades, hasn’t achieved the kind of success his contemporaries like the Khans among others have achieved. Was it because he is undeserving? Not in the least. Then what went wrong? We asked Akshaye and he had the best reply for it,
&ldquo; First thing is, every artist is given a shelf life here. They are being watched for x amount of years, and the audience is watching me even today, it’s been 25 years, what more can an actor ask for? I am a very fortunate person, very few people get this kind of shelf life and I still have time to go. When the audiences decide they don’t want to see this particular artist, they close their chapter. Audience decides everything.&quot;

&quot;David Dhawan didn’t make Varun Dhawan a star, audience did. Ranbir Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Shraddha Kapoor are film industry kids, but who made them a star? You guys made it. We haven’t made Nawazuddin Siddiqui the star in the past 6 years, the audience did. He has been made by the people, they have loved his performance and his work, so one must be very grateful for it, that they gave us so much time.&rdquo;
Twitter
He further added, &ldquo;And the second thing is, I am starring in the best film of the year. You might have not seen the film, but you watch it on Friday, Saturday or whenever you get time. It’s a beautiful film and I am the hero of the film, isse zyaada kya chahie yaar, God has given me everything.&rdquo;
Twitter
Akshaye confesses he is a very boring person and loves to be the way he is,
&ldquo;I don’t enjoy parties. I sleep at 11 in the night. I am a very boring person, I do nothing exciting, I know people talk that I do this or that, but I am a very boring man, don’t expect anything interesting from me.&rdquo;
