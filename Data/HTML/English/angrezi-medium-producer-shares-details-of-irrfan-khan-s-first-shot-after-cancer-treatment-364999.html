The team is currently in Udaipur for the first schedule of the film that is being produced Dinesh Vijan.

&ldquo;Having him (Irrfan) back on the set was a surreal feeling, he’s undoubtedly one of the best actors in the country. When he gave the first shot, everyone around got emotional. For me, it was one of those life-defining moments working with him again after Hindi Medium. Having him and Homi together was something all three of us have always wanted. Irrfan was his usual self…wry humour, crackling one-liners and back on his own turf. Deepak and his improvisations brought the house down. It was just like the first day of Hindi Medium.&rdquo;
Irrfan had shared the heartbreaking details of the diagnosis on Twitter last year.
After the announcement, he flew with his family to London, where he underwent treatment. After being extremely low-key for a year, he finally returned to Mumbai and paps managed to spot him at the airport. Just a few days ago, he penned down a small thank-you note for all his fans and well-wishers who kept in their prayers. He wrote,
&ldquo;Maybe somewhere in the pursuit of winning, we forget how much it means to be loved. In our vulnerability, we are reminded. As I leave my footprints onto these steps of my life, I want to pause to be grateful for receiving your immense love and support, it soothed me in my process of healing. So I travel back to you, thanking you from the bottom of my heart.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
