Pihu, a forthcoming movie whose trailer has been released, is making rounds on social media. Not only fans even the film fraternity is raving about the trailer of Pihu. Watch the terrifying story of the kid, who doesn’t even know what’s safe for her but is left home alone with her mother's dead body:
Wondering how this little girl played the role? Named Myra Vishwakarm, she was indeed two years old when she shot for Pihu.
Talking about the experience shooting for the movie, director Vinod Kapri said: &ldquo;We gave her time to acquaint herself with the space as well as the crew. We would shoot for two hours a day. There were three cameras placed on the set because you can’t ask a two-year-old to give another take. The toys that you see in the film all belong to Myra,&rdquo; he told Indian Express.
