Indiatimes in a interaction with Akshay asked him about his son’s interest in Bollywood, he said,
&ldquo;He is just 16 years old, I would like to let him live his life rather than put pressure on him and ask whether he is interested in films. I am not that kind of a father, I will let him live, he is right now interested to be with his friends, enjoy life and study. Like every youngster, he is very much interested in technology, so I think I will let him live&rdquo;.
