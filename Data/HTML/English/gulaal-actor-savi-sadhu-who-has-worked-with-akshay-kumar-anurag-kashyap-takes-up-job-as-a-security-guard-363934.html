&ldquo;Anurag Kashyap mile struggle karte karte toh mujhe Paanch mei liya, unki jo pehli film thi release nahi hui. Uske baad unhone mujhe Black Friday mei liya, one of the main characters that is Commissioner Samra ka role kiya maine then unke sath maine Gulaal bhi kari. Maine Yash Raj, Subhash ji ke sath, Nikhil Advani ke sath Patiala House kari&rdquo;
Talking about his 'Acting Ka Keeda', he further adds,
&ldquo;Since my brother got a job in Air India, it became easier for me to come to Mumbai. Fir jaise struggle hoti hai... maine shuri kari producers ko milna&rdquo;
Speaking about why things didnâ€™t work out for him in Bollywood he said,
&ldquo;Kaam ki kabhi problem nahi hui. Mujhe hi chhodna pada ki mai nahi kar pa raha hoon. You know... it was like kya mere liye wait kar raha hai... yaha jaise logo ko kaam milta nahi aur mere pas itna kaam hai ki mai kaam nahi kar pa raha. Meri health problems badh rahi hain. Meri financial problems bhi badh gayi, health problems bhi badh gayi toh kaam khatam ho gaya.&rdquo;
He then shared details of the toughest phase of his life. He wrote,
&ldquo;Sabse tough phase wo tha when I lost my wife&rdquo;. He added that he lost everyone close to him to death, including his parents and inlaws.
Sidhu further added that he misses watching films in halls because he has no money to afford tickets.
&ldquo;Mere pas bus ke paise nahi hain apne director producers ko milne ke aise halat hain. Ja ke film dekhna toh mere liye dream hai abhi. Bohot filme miss kar raha hoon... dekhne ka mann karta hai par meri financial position aisi hai&quot;
But hope hasn't died for him. he concludes by saying: &ldquo;They are waiting for me, mai aa raha hoon&rdquo;.
As they say: Remember, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. We hope his dreams see the light of the day soon!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
