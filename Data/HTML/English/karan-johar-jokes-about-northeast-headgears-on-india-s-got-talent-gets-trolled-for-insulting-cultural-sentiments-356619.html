However, this time when Karan Johar attempted to mock his co-judges, it backfired him quite savagely.
What exactly happened? So, Karan Johar posted a video on his Instagram profile, in which he can be seen telling Kirron Kher that &ldquo;she has the guts to wear a bamboo hat&rdquo; (traditional headgear of Arunachal Pradesh). In the video, Kher asked him to wear the Axomiya japi, to which he said &ldquo;it need’s guts to wear it&rdquo;. Karan Johar is also seen telling Kher that with the ‘bamboo cap’ it looks she will sing a ‘kawaali’.

&ldquo;Japi from Assam it’s our emotion. Yahh no doubt you don’t know about Japi because this Assamese tradition is bigger than your fucking film industry. Once you died no one will remember you but &ldquo;অসমীয়া থাকে মানে জাপিৰ আদৰ্শ সদায়ে থাকিব &ldquo;.. sorry you also don’t know Assamese language!! Just ask the meaning from any northeast Indian. And I have a free advice to you Please come to our Northeast and we’ll teach you how we can wear Japi without having the gut (sic),&rdquo; poster another user.
Karan Johar has now deleted the post and issued an apology.
You are absolutely right and I would like to apologise if I have hurt any sentiments.....it was purely unintentional and came from a place of no knowledge which is absolutely no excuse....am extremely sensitive to the different cultures of our land and I am very sorry.... https://t.co/7dgzreI90L — Karan Johar (@karanjohar) November 14, 2018</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
