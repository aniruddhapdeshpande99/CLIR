Well, the outrage over this picture built up when people spotted that this panel didn't include even one single woman from the film industry.
&quot;Where is Rima Das? Her movie is going for Oscars and she has not been included? wrote one user.
But do you think this exists only in Bollywood? Well, the answer sadly is no. In a recent interview with Republic TV, model-actor and fitness enthusiast Milind Soman was asked if he ever came across such incidents as a model. Talking about the same, he said, &ldquo;Not really because when I started modeling, of course, everybody today talks about casting couch concept in films and fashion as well but when I started, fashion was such a new industry that all of us were starting out together so there was no position of power or something like that could encourage this kind of an incident. For me, I was never subjected to this but I know it exists because people talk to me about it.&quot;
