I remember watching Rockstar first day first show in Delhi on 11.11.11. When I stepped out of the theater, I didn't just take Jordan and Heer back home with me but I knew that I am going to listen to each song on an endless loop.
For Rahman too, Rockstar was special. Not many know that for Rahman, the last project about which he really feels good about is Rockstar. In a recent interview, the Mozart of Madras spoke to media and said,
&quot;The last [time] I felt good about a soundtrack was [when working on] Rockstar. There are many challenges [that filmmakers face to get] people to watch movies. So much so, that we have forgotten to catch up with the soul. Sometimes, we need to go back and create something beautiful. For Rockstar, there was a lot of time, commitment and love put into the script, by the actor, director, lyricists and [me]. Then, the concept of content came into existence. Somewhere, the passion of creating a movie is lost; [filmmaking] has become about content creation, not art creation.&quot;
One of Rahman's most successful collaborations has been with filmmaker Imtiaz Ali.
The bond that began with Rockstar moved to Highway and not many know that there is an interesting story behind him being roped in for the Alia Bhatt starrer. Recently, one biography on AR Rahman was written by the author Krishna Trilok and the book was released.

In the book, there is an except which reveals how it was Rahman himself who wanted to compose music for his Imtiaz Ali's 'Highway'.
Imtiaz Ali told, one day, during a Skype conversation, Rahman asked him about his next film after Rockstar. Imtiaz told him about Highway and said that it'd be a small budget venture. He also shared that there is no scope for the music in the film.
When Rahman further asked &ldquo;You want me to do it?&rdquo;, well, Imtiaz shared there was only one situation in the film that demands a song. Rahman again told, &ldquo;Yeah, but do you want me to do it?&rdquo;
Twitter
&ldquo;That’s the thing about Rahman Sir. He makes you see what you want. What you want is the only reality that you are aware of, that’s one thing I learnt from him,&rdquo; Imtiaz shared in this book. And the film ended up having 8 original compositions by Rahman.
This also sums up my relationship with the music of A.R Rahman. While people of my generation trip to EDM and gush over the latest discovery of some foreign bands, I am someone who keeps going back to the OST of Tamasha back and forth.

His track Chaiyya Chaiyya remains my favorite party track and the songs of Bombay and Taal are my antidote to breaking the cobweb of monotony. A lot of times, while chatting with fellow Rahman-lovers, I find it hard to define my top 10 songs of him. How can you?
While the songs from Swades, Tamasha, Dil Se, Roja remain on the top of my list, it makes me feel guilty for not adding Dilli-6, Rockstar, and Highway in this list.

My relationship with Rahman's music is just like the line of his own song: Rehna Tu, Hai Jaisa Tu-Thoda Sa Dard Tu..Thoda Sukoon.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
