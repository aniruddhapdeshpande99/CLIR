In a recent interview with Mid-day Naezy praised Ranveer Singh for his hard work and effort in pulling off the character that is hugely inspired by him and his life. He said,
Instagram
&ldquo;We would constantly speak about the indie scene in India. Ranveer has rapped earlier, so that made things easier for him. Apart from that, he is a great observer. He would study us â€” from our body language, to how we create lyrics for our songs and the kind of language we use in them. When you look at him in the film, it feels as if he has become one of us.&quot;
Naezy added that to get into the skin of his character, Ranveer used to listen to his track Aane De, on loop. Well, he is a method actor and in no way can we ignore the hard work he puts in, in all his roles.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
