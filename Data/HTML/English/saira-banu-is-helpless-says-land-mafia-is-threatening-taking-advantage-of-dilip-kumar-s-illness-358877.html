However, lately, he hasn‚Äôt been keeping well. In past couple of years, he has been hospitalised for complaints of uneasiness, chest infection, dehydration and kidney malfunction several times.
Rumours are also rife that the legendary star who is known as the tragedy king cannot recognise anyone. &ldquo;He cannot recognize anyone; sometimes, not even his own wife Saira ji. He can no longer walk or speak. He even needs to be carried to the bathroom. For all practical purposes, he's oblivious to the world around him,&rdquo; a source close to Daily Hunt had revealed.
Filmmaker Subhash Ghai has also said that he cannot see him Dilip Kumar in such a state.
&ldquo;I love Dilip sahab so much that I don't feel like meeting him anymore. I can't see him like this. When I see him, I feel like crying because we know each other since 20-22 years and I have loved him like my brother. He is unable to recognise me, he does not recognise anyone... He is becoming weaker and by looking at him, I think to myself that never 'be boastful in life',&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by IANS.
Amid all this, Dilip Kumar is also dealing with another hassle. After alleged land mafia and builder Samir Bhojwani, who was earlier arrested for usurping her and the yesteryear susperstar‚Äôs Pali Hill bungalow, was released from jail, Saira Banu approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi for help. She said that they are being threatened by the land mafia.
In an FIR lodged on January 4 this year, Saira alleged that Bhojwani, on the basis of forged documents, illegally staked ownership of land in Pali Hill, Bandra, the rights of which were acquired by Dilip Kumar on September 25, 1953.

Request from Saira Banu Khan: To the Hon‚Äôble @PMOIndia Shri @narendramodi Awaiting for appointment. I am tired of repeated assurances from CM @Dev_Fadnavis &ldquo;I AM TRYING&ldquo; Sir you are the last hope of protecting DILIP SAHAB‚Äôs only house from Land Mafia Samir Bhojwani. I beg üôèüôèüôè ‚Äî Dilip Kumar (@TheDilipKumar) December 18, 2018
Talking in the same regard, Saira Banu recently said, &ldquo;I want the Prime Minister to pay attention to this matter. Chief Minister (Devendra Fadnavis) is making efforts into this, we hope some good result will come after the Prime Minister also intervenes. Bhojwani is taking advantage of Dilip Sahab's illness.&rdquo;
Meanwhile, Dilip Kumar's lawyer Chirag Shah claimed that Bhojwani is an affluent individual, adding, &quot;Opponent has great political connections and money power to file cases time and again even after losing so many times. After Saira ji's complaint, he was arrested for 130-132 days. It seems like apart from Saira and Dilip ji, he has harassed and cheated other people too.&quot;
After Saira Banu tweeted to Prime Minister Modi, an official from the office of Fadnavis said the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) took note of the issue. Fadnavis also assured to look into the matter.
