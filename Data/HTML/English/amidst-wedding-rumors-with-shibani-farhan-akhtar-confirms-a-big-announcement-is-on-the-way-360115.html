This major hint made everyone rack their brains and most of us started thinking in the same direction. That wasn't all. The Gully Boy actor Ranveer Singh instantly reacted to it and shouted &ldquo;Oooh&rdquo; which looked like a friendly nudge.
Just to jog your memory a little, Shibani and Farhan are reportedly dating since 2018 and they have been spotted at a lot of events together.
Today, on Farhan's birthday, Shibani posted a romantic vacay picture and he was quick enough to respond with a 'Love you'!

They made an official appearance together at Deepika and Ranveer's wedding reception, where they arrived holding hands. A news report quoted a source close to a couple saying,
&quot;They are extremely serious about each other and Farhan's kids have also warmed up to Shibani, so this looks like the most obvious step for the two.&quot;
Reports also claim that the couple has already exchanged rings and are engaged. Now, they are targeting at a summer wedding and are zeroing down on the location and caterers!
Well, this escalated quickly but who doesn't like happy endings in love stories? We for sure do. Congrats are in order for the couple who might just make an official wedding announcement real soon.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
