Bharat is a remake of Korean movie titled Ode To My Father, which is a story about a man separated from his father during war, desperately longs to reunite with him and his missing sister. This will be Salman Khanâ€™s third collaboration with Ali Abbas Zafar after Sultan and Tiger Zinda Hai.
The Korean film â€“ Ode To My Father â€“ was a classic hit. Will Bharat live up to the expectations? Only time will tell. Also starring Tabu, Disha Patani and Jackie Shroff, Bharat is scheduled to hit the screens on June 5 (of course around Eid).</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
