'They Have Lost It': Internet Reacts To Govt's Idea Of Roping In Katrina-SRK-Salman For Promoting Urdu!
In what are we outraging against today, we have something very legit. Today, the internet is busy criticizing and slamming the government's plan of roping in Indian actors Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif and Shah Rukh Khan to promote Urdu language in India.
Twitter
Confused? Well, same here! As per reports, Ministry of Human Resource Development's autonomous body National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language (NCPUL) is planning to rope in superstars like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif to endorse the language.
What is NCPUL?
It publishes books in Urdu, organises conferences at national and international level and offers diploma courses in Arabic and Urdu to promote the language. They have been facing challenges from private players, who have been organizing successful events for promotion of Urdu and draw massive crowds of young people.
Their whole idea is to attract more and more people towards Urdu by getting Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan to recite a few lines in Urdu and recording it. These videos later could be used as an effective promotional strategy. Reacting to whole idea, Social media seems angry at the whole idea of bringing Salman and Katrina onboard for promoting the language.

They should apeal to @Javedakhtarjadu sahab. I mean shahrukh toh theek hai par. Salman and katrina. I mean man liya star hai par bolna hi nahi aata toh promote kaise karenge — visitor (@yogi55yogi) March 17, 2019
When the real intellectuals are sidelined, this is the joke you end up with. I would not trust Salman and Katrina with spoken word, forget Urduhttps://t.co/a7vyDdimQF — Ragini (@ragini_jaswal) March 17, 2019
Salman nd shahrukh bhi theek hain but katrina jise hindi tak nahi aati..common ...is desh ko bachao — ⚡Bushra بشرى 🇮🇳⚡ (@bushrastic) March 17, 2019
Modi govt. plans to abuse Urdu by using Katrina, Salman and Shahrukh. Aur ham sab chup hai? — Zainab Mufti (@zainab_mufti24) March 17, 2019
Shahrukh and Salman to samajh mein aaya, lekin Katrina ko approach karna palle nahin pada; wo kaun sa Urdu bolti hai — Vikash Sinha (@Vikashsinha) March 17, 2019
Salim Khan would have been a better choice. Not sure whether Salman can even read Urdu...and Katrina......lesser said is better. — Rajeev Kumria (@Kwitter_Nah) March 17, 2019
Modi govt should really watch some of Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif’s work before choosing them. Salman’s father would however be a very good choice along with Javed Akhtar and Amitabh Bhattacharya. https://t.co/kT029Qmg27 — Mohit Raj (@_MohitRaj) March 17, 2019
Muslim names = Urdu? 😂😂Salman and Katrina as Urdu ambassadors is direct assault on Urdu. Have you heard them?
Shahrukh toh phir bhi bol letaa hai. https://t.co/eIGoyeVKjt — Sabbah Haji Baji (@imsabbah) March 17, 2019
Katrina & Salman seriously ?
Please spare Urdu. 🙏 https://t.co/bW8Guo5CgX — Prasanna Jain (@jainprasanna0) March 17, 2019
SRK has doctorate honourary from a Urdu University and has genuine knowledge of Urdu ... But Salman Khan and more over Katrina Kaif ?? Seriously...? 🙄 — IamPrabhaskarJha_12 (@PrabhaskarJha) March 17, 2019
Katrina & Salman to promote Urdu! Irony just died Thousand Deaths 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 — Rahul D / राहुल / راحول (@rdalwale) March 17, 2019
What an extraordinary league! SRK hams it, Salman has zero diction and Katrina is unable to deliver a line in Urdu/Hindi without rote learning https://t.co/jliSun852Q — Sadiq ‘Sameer’ Bhat (@sadiquiz) March 17, 2019
Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif can't speak any language with any proficiency ffs https://t.co/Rq27Sot09X — Sridhar Shelat (@SridharShelat) March 17, 2019</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
