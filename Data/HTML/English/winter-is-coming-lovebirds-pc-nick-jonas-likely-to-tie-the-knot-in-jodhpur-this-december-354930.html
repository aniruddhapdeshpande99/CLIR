&ldquo;Nick and Priyanka were recently in India and had even gone to Jodhpur. That was when they decided the gorgeous Umaid Bhawan to be their dream wedding venue. They will have a limited guest list of 200 people with only their close friends and family in attendance. Since a lot of their Hollywood friends are settled in New York, PC is quite excited to have her bridal shower there followed by a grand wedding in Jodhpur&rdquo;.
If we talk about PC's wedding lehenga, reports suggest that it would be designed by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla.
