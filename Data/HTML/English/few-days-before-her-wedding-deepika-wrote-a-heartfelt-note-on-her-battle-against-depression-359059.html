Few Days Before Her Wedding, Deepika Wrote A Heartfelt Note On Her Battle Against Depression
Acting is a profession that can get both rewarding and demanding for actors. While many enjoy the perks that they get with their profession, a few crumble down beneath the pressure of performance and personal/professional failures.
It takes a lot of guts and courage for the actors to come out and share their story of failure and personal lows. For Deepika Padukone, who has had only hits and mega-successes since last few years, it was a huge thing to come and talk about depression.
While she has been in news for her dreamy wedding to her long-time boyfriend Ranveer Singh in Italy, Padukone has also been aspirational and inspirational for a lot of other reasons.
She is one of the key supporters of mental health initiatives in India and not many know that just a few days before her wedding, the Piku Actress penned a note about depression.

Deepika wrote a letter for her fans via Elle India magazine, where she wrote about her struggle with the disease, how her support system helped her and how she now wants to focus on helping others in similar situations to seek help.
Sharing the letter on their Instagram page, Elle India wrote:
Vogue India
&ldquo;A few days before her wedding @deepikapadukone wrote a letter addressing her struggle with anxiety and depression, for our 22nd Anniversary Issue. By publicly talking about her own battles, she empowered many to reach out and seek help. Her letter is full of empathy and kindness, a reminder that (in the words of Stephen Fry) &ldquo;it will be sunny one day&rdquo;.&rdquo;
An excerpt from her letter reads:
&quot;To anyone who sees darkness, I would like to say that you are not alone and that help is always available. For in the words of Stephen Fry, &quot;It will be sunny one day&quot;. &quot; Deepika and Ranveer are currently enjoying their married life while fulfilling their professional commitments.
