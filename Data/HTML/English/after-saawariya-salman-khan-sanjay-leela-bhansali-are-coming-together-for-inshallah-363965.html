After Saawariya, Salman Khan & Sanjay Leela Bhansali Are Coming Together For 'Inshallah'
Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali's vision was to cast Salman Khan in Bajirao Mastani alongside Aishwarya Rai. He tried convincing him for 15 years but the equation between Aishwarya and Salman were so sour that there was no room for reconciliation.
Ultimately, Sanjay Leela Bhansali had to move on with a new pair Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh and he couldn't be more grateful. The jodi turned out to be mega hit in every film.

But Sanjay's wish was to always get Salman Khan back on board. After Saawariya, where Sallu mian played a guest cameo, the actor is all set to collaborate with Sanjay leela Bhansali for an upcoming film.
