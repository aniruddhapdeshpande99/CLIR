&ldquo;I don’t know if my character will be a main one in the next season. I got a call last night that I have to meet Varun Grover (the writer), so the team is trying to get our busy schedules matched. We may be in the clear about the role by next week, hopefully.&rdquo;

He added that Guruji was supposed to be kept a secret initially.
&ldquo;My character was kind of kept hidden. I shot for the series for just one day after the main shooting was over. They thought ‘Let’s bring this character into the light’. Initially, that was not the plan. Something happened that they didn’t announce this differently and I am not someone who likes tom-tomming. It was a small role in the beginning, so we did not promote it as if it were a main one in the first season,&rdquo; he added.
Well, fans want to see more of Pankal Tripathi AKA Guruji in Sacred Games season 2.
