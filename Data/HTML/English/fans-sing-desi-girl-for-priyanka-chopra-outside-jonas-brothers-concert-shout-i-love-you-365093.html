When Priyanka Chopra had danced to Desi Girl, she hadn’t even made her Hollywood debut.

In one of the videos that is now going viral on social media, fans can be heard singing Desi Girl for her outside the concert venue. &ldquo;Priyanka, I love you! My desi girl!,&rdquo; hooted one of them before singing the Desi Girl song.
Priyanka was greeting a little girl when this happened. She waved in the direction before moving to the vehicle that was waiting for her. Isn’t she a diva?
Priyanka Chopra seemingly had a blast at the concert. In one of the other videos, she can be seen doing the Galla Goodiyaan hook step on Jonas Brothers’ new song Sucker. What’s more? She even taught her sister in laws Sophie Turner and Danielle Jonas this step. Take a look!
