And why wouldn't he be? Box office numbers and movie business are highly unpredictable.
The fact that Shah Rukh Khan’s last release Jab Harry Met Sejal also failed miserably at the box office disappointing his ardent fans, he was eagerly waiting for this one to release and so were his fans.
Zero, an Anand L Rai film which also starred Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif, opened to mixed reviews with its box office collection dipping low on the very second day. The movie minted Rs 20 crore on day one and Rs 18 crore on day two.

While some of the fans were highly disappointed with the movie, others loved it.
And one of them was Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai. Highly impressed by Shah Rukh Khan’s performance in the movie, Malala Yousafzai showered praises upon Shah Rukh Khan’s performance in Zero and said that she and her family loved the movie.
Anurag Kashyap, too, was highly impressed. Calling Zero a &ldquo;brave&rdquo; movie, he said, that the Shah Rukh Khan starrer deserves a viewing on so many grounds.
Really really liked &ldquo;Zero&rdquo;. Barring one sequence where all the stars gather post interval, which disconnected me .No easy resolutions , streching the imagination its really a brave film. It engaged me through out. I really feel its the people’s expectations that disappoints them — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) December 22, 2018
I have always maintained and tell my people , that best way to read a book and watch a film is to go in with a blank slate . And its ironical that the reason some films get made (superstars) is also the reason they are not seen in correct perspective . — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) December 22, 2018
Zero deserves a viewing just for so many new grounds it breaks within the mainstream . And then seeing all the Stars getting out of their comfort zones and pushing themselves by breaking the typecasts, breaking the expectations and not playing safe. I really liked the film . — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72) December 22, 2018
