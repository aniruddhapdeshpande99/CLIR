Dear @iamsrk, when on a brief visit to Munnar yesterday I took rest in the room you occupied in 2013, which has been converted into a shrine for you & #ChennaiExpress! Every wall is decorated w/posters of the film &the suite is dominated by this cut-out of you. No place for rest! pic.twitter.com/hFUYCgXLEc — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) January 21, 2019
Tharoor took to his social media accounts to share this news and friends have gone berserk since then. He tweeted,
&ldquo;Jhansi aap bhi chahte hai aur mein bhi, fark sirf itna hai, aapko raj karna hai, aur mujhe apno ki seva.&rdquo; Hrithik delivered the same in Ashutosh Gowariker’s film, &ldquo;Antar hai Maham, tu Mohenjo Daro pe raaj karna chahta hai aur main seva.&rdquo;

While we gushed over the #DeepVeer wedding pictures for months, we now have a fresh batch of pictures that will make you wish, you had a friend like Deepika on your wedding day too. Fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee shared pictures from Deepika's friend Srila Rao's wedding who was also his client.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
