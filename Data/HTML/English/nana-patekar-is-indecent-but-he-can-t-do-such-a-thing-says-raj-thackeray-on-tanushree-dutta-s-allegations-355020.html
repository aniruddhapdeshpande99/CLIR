&ldquo;I know Nana Patekar; he is indecent. He does crazy things but I don't think he can do such a thing. Court will look into it. What is the media to do with it? #MeToo is a serious matter, the debate over it on Twitter isn't right,&rdquo; he said.
He added that the court will look into the matter and that people on social media should stop discussing it arriving at a conclusion.

Furthermore, he said that women should raise their voice about such incidents but not after 10 years.
&ldquo;It seems it is being done to divert attention from petrol price, rupee value, and unemployment. If anything like #MeToo happens, women can come to MNS. We will teach a lesson to accused. Women must raise the voice when they face oppression, not after 10 years.&rdquo;
