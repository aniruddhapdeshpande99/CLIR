Rana Daggubati's Birthday Wish For 'Brother' Prabhas Is All About Bromance And Love!
Rana Daggubati and Prabhas are not just co-stars. The actors who worked together in India's most popular film franchise Baahubali are no less than 'brothers' and their real-life camaraderie proves just the same. Their official association might have ended with the end of the shoot of their movie but they continue to be good friends.
Today is Prabhas' birthday and the actor has turned a year older. His fans and followers on social media are flooding the internet with his pictures and videos.

However, one wish that will surely make Prabhas very happy is Rana Daggubati's.
Wishing his on-screen brother 'Amarendra Baahubali', the picture that Rana shared is just about perfect.
