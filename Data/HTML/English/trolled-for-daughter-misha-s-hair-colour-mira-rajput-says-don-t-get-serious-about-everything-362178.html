Trolled For Daughter Misha’s Hair Colour, Mira Rajput Says 'Don’t Get Serious About Everything'
Shahid Kapoor’s wife Mira Rajput had recently uploaded pictures of her daughter’s hair colour on Instagram and since then she has been facing the heat. She was trolled left, right and centre. Finally, Mira has responded to the trolls.
&quot;It wasn't a colour. It was a regular paint. She (Misha) just had nice time and I think it's just about letting your children to be creative, letting them be free and letting them to have a good time. I think it doesn't make sense to get serious about everything,&quot; Mira told the media on Wednesday during the Helping Hand Exhibition cum Fundraiser event.
Last week, Mira shared a photograph in which her two-year-old daughter Misha was seen having red tresses. &quot;I'm not a regular mom, I'm a cool mom,&quot; she captioned the photograph. But the photograph didn't go well with the netizens as they started criticising Mira. Following the backlash, she posted another photograph of Misha and wrote, &quot;Relax guys it's just temporary. Wait till I'm 5.&quot;

The event was organised to support TATA Memorial Hospital's pediatric oncology ward here. Talking about the event, Mira said, &quot;I am really happy associating myself with Helping Hands Exhibition cum Fundraiser. They have organised a really nice event and it has been organised to support a very noble cause.
&quot;Kids were really happy and we just had to warm them up. I feel they had a good time at this event.&quot;
Mira tied the knot with Shahid in July 2015. They welcomed their first child Misha in 2016 and son Zain in 2018.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
