Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone tied the knot in Italy and every bit of their wedding was like a chapter straight out of a fairy tale.
While no one from Bollywood could make a cut in their guest-list, their wedding was exactly how it should have been about them and their family. If we talk about family, just like Ranveer, who is popular for being an enthu-cutlet, looks like his Dad Jagjit Singh Bhavnani is also as filmy as his son!
According to an Instagram story posted on social media, Ranveer's Stylist revealed a sweet thing to the world. She wrote,
&quot;Presenting the newly minted Mrs & Mr. Ranveer Singh Bhavnani!!&quot; She also added, &quot;In the words of Mr. Bhavnani Sr today, yeh deewani toh Bhavnani ho gayi!&quot;
Well, this was Mr. Bhavnani's way of welcoming Deepika into their world but it was sure was an epic one.

Considering how Ranveer-Deepika's love blossomed and then grew on the sets of their next film Bajirao Mastani, this was an absolutely special filmy ode to the couple.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
