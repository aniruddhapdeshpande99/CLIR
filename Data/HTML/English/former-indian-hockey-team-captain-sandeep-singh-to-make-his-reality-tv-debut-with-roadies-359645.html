&quot;'Roadies Real Heroes' is about finding such interesting individuals and offering them a platform to emerge victoriously. As a concept, this season completely resonates with what I follow personally and hence I am happy to associate with 'Roadies Real Heroes' as a gang leader.
&quot;It's going to be a new experience and I am eager to explore something I haven't done before,&quot; he added.
Apart from Singh, Neha Dhupia, Nikhil Chinapa, Raftaar, Prince Narula and Rannvijay Singha will be back in the show. &quot;Roadies Real Heroes&quot; will premiere on MTV in India.
