In The Wake Of Support Scheme Of Rs 6K For Farmers, Vishal Dadlani Says They Don't Need Charity
Vishal Dadlani has been actively voicing out opinions on things that matter. Often, when he is wrong he apologises too. The music composer and singer was once a celebrity supporter of Aam Aadmi Party but had later announced that he was quitting all political work after outrage over one of his tweets in which he mocked Jain religious leader Tarun Saga.

Recently, he slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his statement on the speedy trial of rape victims during his governance. In a tweet, Vishal Dadlani called it a lie and requested the prime minister to not &ldquo;turn the pain of Indian women and girls into propaganda.&rdquo;
LIE! Name one rapist who has been hung in your term, Sir. Nirbhaya's rapists, Asifa's rapists, even Unnao child-rape-accused BJP MLA Sengar are still alive and well.@narendramodi ji, we know elections are near, but don't turn the pain of Indian women & girls into propaganda. üôèüèΩ https://t.co/rJuMMJNef8 ‚Äî VISHAL DADLANI (@VishalDadlani) January 30, 2019

They seem to be trying to pave over 4.5 years of sheer neglect and disastrous policy failure.
Rs. 6000 farmer per year, instead of guaranteeing a Minimum Sale Price for their crops, is adding insult to injury
