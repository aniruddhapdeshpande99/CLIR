As for Northern California, the Camp Fire near Oroville has torched 111,000 acres, killed 42 people and destroyed 6,453 homes as of Sunday evening, reported Cal Fire. The first responders are battling blazes on both ends of the state popularly called as the Town Of Paradise.
At this very moment, three fires - The Woolsey Fire, The Camp Fire and The Hills Fire are blazing across the US state of California. The reason? Dry underbrush, combined with winds and hot temperatures became the perfect breeding ground for fires to ignite. While the exact cause is still unknown, the seasonal Santa Ana winds have been spreading the flames rapidly.
