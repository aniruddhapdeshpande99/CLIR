The 47-year-old filmmaker, who is known for giving Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) a grounded tone along with his brother Anthony Russo, finds Priyanka 'fantastic' and would love to work with her. Confirming the news, he said,
&quot;Priyanka is transitioning into global status now. She is fantastic... (I would) Love to work with her... I am potentially talking to Priyanka for something. I am not going to say what it is.&quot;
Last year, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige had said that they are planning to make a standalone on superhero Ms Marvel aka Kamala Khan. After the news broke, many fans on social media expressed their desire to see Priyanka playing the character of Marvel's first Muslim superhero.
Russo is currently in India to promote the MCU's much-awaited superhero ensemble, &quot;Endgame&quot;, which will hit the theatres on April 26. The filmmaker said as an action director Indian films like Dabangg series were an interesting watch for him.
&quot;I'm an action director so I saw 'Dabangg' many years ago and then 'Dabangg 2'. I thought the camera work was great in these films. The tone and energy is also great. So, I certainly know Salman Khan,&quot; he added.
Russo also revealed that the climax of Marvel's 2015 film &quot;Avengers: Age of Ultron&quot; almost had a scene inspired by Rajinikanth's 2010 blockbuster &quot;Robot&quot; (&quot;Enthiran&quot;).
