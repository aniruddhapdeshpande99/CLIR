This one is my personal favourite as it has Ranbir Kapoor and Vicky Kaushal together. These two stars left us spellbound with their mind blowing performances in Sanju, especially Vicky, who was a surprise package in it. This film bought all the recognition for Vicky that he deserved. Fans are going gaga over their reunion.

This is one of the sweetest selfies. Aishwarya Bachchan shared this adorable picture with her two lifelines, hubby Abhishek Bachchan and their daughter Aaradhya.
