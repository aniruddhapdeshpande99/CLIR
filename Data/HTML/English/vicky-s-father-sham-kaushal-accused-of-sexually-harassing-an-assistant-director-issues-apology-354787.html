Sham Kushal took to Twitter to issue an apology.
Yesterday, while speaking about the #MeToo movement, Sham Kaushal‚Äôs son Vicky Kaushal had said that it is necessary to believe women and pay attention to their stories.
&ldquo;It is an important cultural shift. It is a beautiful shift happening. It is so amazing to see so many women coming out with their stories of what happened with them. It doesn't matter whether it is one day or one year or ten years or 100 years. It is a still very difficult for women to come out with a story like this and place it front of the entire world in it's most naked form.

&ldquo;The least we can do is we can hear them and give them a platform and dignity to say what happened with them and assure them that it will be taken seriously. It is high time something like this happened,&rdquo; Vicky Kaushal told PTI.
