Sohum Shah Grateful After Tumbbad's Success, Reveals It Took Him 6 Years To Make The Film
Right now, everyone is talking about this crazy and unconventional film Tumbbad and the lead actor of the film Sohum Shah. If you have watched the film then we are sure you were blown away and if you haven’t then you are surely missing out on something really good. Tumbbad was a small film but the good word of mouth made the film what it is today.
After watching Tumbbad, Indiatimes had a quick interaction with the lead star Sohum Shah, whose magnificent acting left everyone speechless and how.
We asked him what’s the best part of Tumbbad, to which he said,
&ldquo; I got to play Vinayak’s character which was my dream role, I feel characters like Vinayak are made once in a lifetime, Tumbbad was a beautiful journey for me which is very close to my heart&rdquo;.

We quizzed him whether Tumbbad’s success will get him more commercial role in Bollywood, he confidently replied,
&ldquo;Tumbbad is a commercial film, the opening of the film was not good, but with good word of mouth bought success to this film. I feel I will definitely get more commercial roles now after Tumbbad.&rdquo;
The actor even revealed how he hasn’t seen failure in life, but Tumbbad’s time span frustrated him. Sohum Shah who is also the producer of the film says,
&ldquo; I have been very fortunate in life, I haven’t seen failures in life, I have achieved success in whatever I have tried, yes but it took a lot of time for me to reach here, so maybe time was a failure for me, like it took me 6 years to make Tumbbad which was frustrating, but you should take failure the way it is, you shouldn’t stop working, our duty is to move on and work hard, rest is destiny. You should stress with failures, yes failures get the frustration but you should take it easy. Failures taught me to move on and not get scared.&rdquo;
We asked him which recent Bollywood film he has been and wishes to be a part of and very honestly the actor replied, &ldquo; I loved Padmavaat, I loved Ranveer Singh’s role, I wish I got play his role, his character was very attractive.&rdquo;
Lastly, we asked his view on the on-going MeToo movement, he said,
&ldquo; I am very happy that this conversation is happening in society, I also have a daughter, with this conversation the society is moving in a safer environment. This MeToo movement should have happened much earlier, but it’s never too late.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
