He was on cloud nine when he won the award at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. He was high on happiness. So much so, that the man who played the role of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody so spectacularly, tumbled off the stage soon after his thanking speech.
He had a shocked expression on his face too. He apparently didn’t care about his surroundings at that point of time. Luckily, the trophy stayed in one piece. He faced no injuries but paramedics were called soon after to treat Rami Malek.
Rami Malek is definitely on a winning streak. He is now in talks to play the antagonist in the latest installment of James Bond franchise.
Even earlier as well, it was reported that Rami Malek is being eyed for the role of villain in the 25th James Bond movie. However, he was busy with his schedule on the last season of his breakout show Mr. Robot which shoots from March through July. According to Collider, the actor's team has successfully managed his shooting schedule to accommodate the Bond film.
