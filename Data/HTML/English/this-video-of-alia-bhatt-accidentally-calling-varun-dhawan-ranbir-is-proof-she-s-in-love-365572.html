In the video, Varun, who is not only Aliaâ€™s co-star but a friend, is seen playing with Alia's hair. While she asked him to stop but in the process ended up calling him Ran but soon she realised her little goof up and asked Varun not to do and busted into laughter. Infact, Sona, Adi, and Varun too had a hearty laugh on Aliaâ€™s adorable mistake.

In fact, her laughter is winning the internetâ€™s heart.
I love love love Alia's laugh. It's so real, it'll automatically put up a smile on my face.
Weird how y'all have issues on how someone laughs ðŸ˜‚pic.twitter.com/pFamOP7iFU â€” Abhishek Varman Stan. (@Ciiimonex) April 13, 2019
Wonder how will RK react to Aliaâ€™s this adorable galti se mistake. Alia and Ranbir are in a relationship since a year now and the couple doesnâ€™t seem to be hesitant in expressing their love in public.
Ranbir who always preferred to keep his personal relationships away from the media glare has no qualms in openly hugging, kissing and holding his girlfriend Alia's hand in public. Looks like the couple has found their comfortable zone.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
