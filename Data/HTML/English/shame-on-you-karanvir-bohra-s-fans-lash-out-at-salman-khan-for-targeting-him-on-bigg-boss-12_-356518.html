In the last episode of the show, Salman Khan was apparently on a slamming spree. From Deepak Thakur, Romil, Surbhi to Dipika Kakkar, he slammed everyone for their behaviour and performance in tasks, including Karanvir Bohra.
Salman Khan was seen calling out Dipika Kakkar for being biased towards Karanvir Bohra during the captaincy task, and that didn’t go down well with the TV actor’s fans. Adding to that, Salman also mocked his fashion sense yet again leaving the fans furious.

@BeingSalmanKhan Stop humiliating #KVB for no reason at all just to embarrass and mock him. Pick someone your own size if you have the balls. #StopTargetingKaranvir This shit is just making you out to be an asshole and only making KV more popular.#ShameOnYou #BB12 — Rishab Nayyar (@NayyarRishab) November 11, 2018

The reason behind rejection of #BiggBoss12 is the way @BeingSalmanKhan & makers r trying to portrayed a criminal, nonsense guy #sreesanth as a saint.
Also Salman insulting #KaranvirBohra from day one. No one is bigger than public & we r witnessing the partiality#BB12 @TheKhbri — ARMAN (NZR) (@ArmanArmu01) November 12, 2018

Reason why i love #KaranvirBohra is
Strong
Patient
Knowns how fight his battle
Take criticism sportingly
Ignore haters with smile
Bear torcher of salman and makers like a warrior
Believe in silence not on barking
Knowns how to maintain dignity#StopTargetingKaranvir @BiggBoss — KVBarmy🥇 (@KVBarmy) November 11, 2018

You might bully him, You might laugh at him, You might make him the object of mockery but no one can be as charismatic as him. #KaranvirBohra is a pure soul. Love and Power to you ❤️ #BiggBoss12 #BigBoss12 #BiggBoss #BB12 #WeekendKaVaar #WeekendKaVaarWithSalman #ColorsTV — Valentina Chopra (@Valentinachopra) November 11, 2018

Just #KaranvirBohra is humble and taking things sportingly doesn't give you the right @BiggBoss and #SalmanKhan to harass him torcher him amd bash him every weekend. You guys are doing this so that you can easily evict him. Shame on you losers.#StopTargetingKaranvir — KVBarmy🥇 (@KVBarmy) November 11, 2018
