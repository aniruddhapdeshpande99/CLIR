After a tough battle with cancer, Sonali is happy to resume work and face the camera. She took to Instagram to pen down her feelings. She wrote,
&quot;Being back on a set after a major sabbatical – one that has been testing in many ways on so many levels – is a surreal feeling.
After all this, I sort of feel an additional sense of purpose and meaning and I'm so grateful to be back in action. I don’t think words would do justice to how beautiful it feels to be back at work...to face the camera again and portray the range of emotions required.
Given that my emotions have been running high for the last couple of months, it feels good to give into the emotions that the job requires. It's just the kind of day that helps me #SwitchOnTheSunshine&quot;
Sonali has received great support from her husband Goldie Behl and son Ranveer and her friends from the fraternity too were always there for her.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
