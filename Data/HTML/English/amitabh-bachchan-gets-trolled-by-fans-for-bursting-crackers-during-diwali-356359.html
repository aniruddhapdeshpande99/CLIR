But there are few who fail to understand that pollution is slowly killing us and if we do not take precautions now, the world will definitely come to an end very soon. Lots of Bollywood celebrities too requested their fans to not burst crackers in Diwali and celebrate the festival smoke-free.
The entire Bollywood too celebrated Diwali with their loved ones and shared the pictures on social media. Amitabh Bachchan too shared happy family pictures celebrating Diwali. But the celebration pictures didn’t go down well with his fans due to firecrackers in Bachchan’s hand. Well, if you see the picture closely, AB is lighting a fuljadi which also creates pollution and it could have been avoided.
The fans are brutally trolling Amitabh Bachchan for not celebrating a pollution-free Diwali. Instagrammers had a field day, pointing out how Big B was irresponsible in bursting crackers along with his family.
