Editors Note: Story updated with a statement from Amazon.
Who would have thought in the ‚Äô80s or early ‚Äô90s that you can sit at home and order products that you want, including the groceries? Well, now this glorious invention is as common as pollution in Delhi.

And why not? It is just so convenient, right? You no more have to deal with over-enthusiastic salespersons or travel at multiple stores to find the right product, and also, no more standing in the long queues at the billing counter. Online shopping has made shopping experience simpler.
Or maybe not!

People have received soaps and bricks when they ordered mobile phones. Flipkart once had to pay Rs 10,000 as compensation for delivering wrong product to a customer. Can you even imagine?
But guess what? No just us, it happens to celebrities as well!
Twitter
So recently, Sonakshi Sinha ordered premium Bose headphones from Amazon, because who wouldn‚Äôt want stuff being delivered at your doorstep? And guess what she got instead of that? A tap-like metal object!
Following this, Sonakshi did exactly what you would have done. She wrote to Amazon on Twitter to bring this to their notice. And being a celeb that she is, the tweet went viral in no time.
Hey @amazonIN! Look what i got instead of the @bose headphones i ordered! Properly packed and unopened box, looked legit... but only on the outside. Oh and your customer service doesnt even want to help, thats what makes it even worse. pic.twitter.com/sA1TwRNwGl ‚Äî Sonakshi Sinha (@sonakshisinha) December 11, 2018
If you think people sympathised with her at this, you might want to take another guess. They were instead happy that Amazon isn‚Äôt partial when it comes to duping their customers and that the company treats all their customers equally.

Amazon, on the other hand, was quick enough to apologise!
