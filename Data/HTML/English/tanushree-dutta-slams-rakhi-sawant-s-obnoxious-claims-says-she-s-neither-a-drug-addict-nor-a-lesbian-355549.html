For many of us, going through Sawant's Instagram account was a source of endless laughter and entertainment, now the time has come to boycott her.
If you are wondering why, let me take you through. Just a few days ago, she held a press conference, where she accused Tanushree Dutta of raping her multiple times twelve years ago. Saying that Tanushree is actually a 'man from the inside', she also said that she is a lesbian. In her absurd claims, she added how Tanushree used to take her to rave parties and forced her to consume drugs.
And now, the lady in question has responded. Issuing a statement against Sawant's obnoxious claims, Tanushree said,
&quot;For those uninitiated in the art of guerrilla war tactics: Smear campaigns never run fair or square. So just to set the record straight: I'm not a drug addict, I don't smoke or drink and I'm most definitely not a lesbian.&quot;
Tanushree added how, &quot;too much of a woman for this patriarchal and misogynistic cesspool to handle&quot; and that's the reason why Rakhi is making &quot;perverted character assassination attempts&quot; to silence her, she said.
