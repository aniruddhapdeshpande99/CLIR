Just a few days ago she blasted Veena Malik for taking a dig at the IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman. And now she slammed comedian Trevor Noah for his insensitive joke on the current tension between both the countries.

Trevor joked about how Indian military must be fighting with Pakistan in Bollywood style and even sang a few Hindi songs. Swara called his joke cruel and racist and blasted him.

Swara is known for sharing her opinions in every situation and she is appreciated for that, but sometimes she even gets trolled for it, but she doesn’t give a damn and that’s what we love about her. Way to go girl!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
