Ajay Devgn Thanks Cricketer Krunal Pandya For Birthday Wishes, Suggests They Should Do A Double-Role Film
Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn recently celebrated his 50th birthday on Tuesday. From his fans to family, everyone wished the popular actor on social media. One person whose birthday wishes stood out was Mumbai Indians cricketer Krunal Pandya.

You must be wondering what makes his wish any different. Well, apart from being a talented young cricketer, Krunal also looks like Ajay Devgn. Yes, it won't be wrong to say he's Ajay Devgn's doppelganger.
So when the all rounder shared a picture of himself with the birthday boy, &quot;Singham, Superstar and my doppelganger. Happy birthday to one of my favourite actors @ajaydevgn #HappyBirthdayAjayDevgn&quot;, Ajay Devgn had a snazzy comeback.
