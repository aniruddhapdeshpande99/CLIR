It's none other than Kartik Aaryan. He is the latest entrant in Bollywood who is looked upto as the megastar in the making. Being an important public figure, it was important to ask him about the #MeToo movement.
Even though, he has not worked with filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani yet, he still feels law should handle the case.
&quot;We all have been his fans. The situation is such that one has to follow the legal route and till the time it is not proven legally we can't talk about it. We don't know what exactly has happened, there has to be a way, we have legal option and that should be followed and then you can comment.

&quot;It is sad that such things are happening be it in this industry or anywhere else. I am totally against it,&quot; Kartik told reporters at an event.
