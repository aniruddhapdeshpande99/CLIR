In the age of over-the-top media service platforms like Netflix, how can you expect censorship to not apply to the internet?
For some, art can be intimidating too. Thatâ€™s perhaps the reason why an episode of Patriotic Act with Hasan Minhaj, is pulled from streaming in Saudi Arabia after its government complained that it showed the kingdom in a negative light.

The episode apparently focused on journalist Jamal Khashoggiâ€™s killing inside Turkeyâ€™s Saudi consulate. It is said that during the act, host Hasan Minhaj referred to Silicon Valley as &ldquo;swimming in Saudi cash&rdquo;. He also criticised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Kingdom-backed war in Yemen.

&ldquo;Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim, and as an American,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying in the episode that has now been pulled from Saudi Arabia.

According to the Saudi government, the episode violated the kingdomâ€™s anti-crime law. Following a legal request, Netflix decided to pull down the episode.
&ldquo;We strongly support artistic freedom and removed this episode only in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request - and to comply with local law,&rdquo; Netflixâ€™s spokesperson was quoted as saying in a statement.
And people are disappointed!

A more apt description would be the lack of balls of Netflix executives for pulling the Patriot act episode on Saudi Arabia. You should be ashamed . â€” Arpan Bhattacharya (@ArpanAlterEgo) January 2, 2019

We should be really worried that Netflix pulled the &ldquo;Saudi Arabia&rdquo; episode from Patriot Act. â€” Fariha RÃ³isÃ­n (@fariharoisin) January 2, 2019

Anyone for censorship? On his brilliant program @patriotact, @hasanminhaj devoted an episode to Saudi Arabia. Then #Netflix bowed to the kingdom's &quot;request&quot; that the episode be banned in-country. Score another point for profits before principles. https://t.co/rpDmR0a56d â€” Randy B Hecht (@RandyBHecht) January 1, 2019

You should never negotiate with terrorists @netflix.
Giving in to the murdering thug Mohammed bin Salman by deleting @hasanminhajâ€™s #PatriotAct episode is #UnAmerican. #NeverForget â€” AC (@Abhinary) January 2, 2019

#Netflix removed an episode of Patriot Act because it was critical of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are stuck in the Dark Ages like all brutal Islamist regimes. Muslims have never had #FreeSpeech and we must stop them taking over Europe... #DeportIslam ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º â€” Sons of Odin (@RitesofOdin) January 2, 2019</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
