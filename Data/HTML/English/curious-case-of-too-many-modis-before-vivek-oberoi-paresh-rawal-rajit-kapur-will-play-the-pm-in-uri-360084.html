Curious Case Of Too Many Modis! Before Vivek Oberoi & Paresh Rawal, Rajit Kapur Will Play The PM In 'Uri'
Unless you have been living under a rock, we are sure you know that Vivek Oberoi’s Bollywood career has apparently been revived as the actor is all set to play the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his biopic.
Ever since the first look of the movie is out, it is making waves on social media. There is so much buzz around it that all dining table discussions revolve around it.
Ahead of the elections, most debates on social media obviously revolve around politics, but now people have another reason to talk about the political climate of the nation. After all, so many movies – including Uri: The surgical Strike, PM Narendra Modi, The Accidental Prime Minister and Thackeray among others – based on political leaders are going to be released on the big screen soon.
If things weren’t complicated enough already, to entangle you in the cobweb of confusion even further, let us tell you that you’ll see PM Modi’s character in not one but three movies.
The first, you know is a biopic on the PM, and Vivek Oberoi is playing the lead role.
The second one, is another biopic on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and in this one Paresh Rawal will play the titular role.
This movie was announced by Rawal in 2017. However, there wasn’t any update on it post that. Of course, Vivek Oberoi's project on PM Modi came as a huge shock to Paresh Rawal as well.
&ldquo;I still maintain that nobody can play Modi other than me. I can do complete justice to the role. However, it’s a free country and even Vivek can play that role. I wish him luck. What I can do with that film, nobody else can. Let anybody do what they want to, we are also coming out soon.&rdquo; he told The Asian Age.

The third film that will feature a character based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi is Uri: The Surgical Strike – that stars Vicky Kaushal in the lead role and is releasing on Jan 11.
Wondering who is playing Modi in this film? Rajit Kapur. To jog your memory a little, Rajit Kapur played the role of Alia Bhatt's father in Raazi, and now he’ll be seen playing Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Uri: The Surgical Strike.
If reports are to be believed, his role is limited to a few scenes, which will be not more than a cameo appearance, but still, it’s going to be interesting to watch so many Modis on screen, don’t you agree?
And then why would people talk about these movies being propaganda?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
