But there is one old interview of the filmmaker that is going viral, where he is seen speaking about how bad he was in his relationships and ill-treated women in his life.
Sajid says,
&ldquo;Out of so many relationships that I have learned that I was a big dog in my twenties. I was a very 'kamina' aadmi. I have broken a lot of hearts. I have lied. I have cheated and deceived like most of the guys do. But I was on a television and I was getting successful. I was treating women very badly.&quot;
Twitter
He even justified himself by saying that filmmaking made him more focused, &ldquo;All the nice girls in my life, I have treated them very bad in my twenties. In my thirty somewhere, I started concentrating on my film-making. so, when you start making films, you don't mentally start getting attracted to women.&rdquo;
