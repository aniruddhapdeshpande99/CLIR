&quot;Today things are different than what they were ten years ago, in terms of the shelf life of female actors. Now they have more shelf life or as much shelf life as male actors. &quot;...There is no difference today but earlier there was.
We have Tabu and Kajol and others working still,&quot; Ajay told reporters here at the trailer launch of De De Pyaar De. The 50-year-old actor said working on the romantic comedy after a long gap was a great experience for him. The actor also celebrated his birthday at the trailer launch and said age is just a number.

&quot;Ageing is about how you feel and not about the number. All my contemporaries are so fit. I think staying fit must be a conscious decision because the intention was that what you could do 25 years ago... you could still do it.
