You can either give up on it or fight back. For Tahira Kashyap, this storm came in the form of cancer.
On September 22, Tahira revealed that she has been detected with pre-invasive breast cancer. She posted on Instagram that she was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in her right breast with high grade malignant cells. &ldquo;Simply put stage 0 cancer/pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in a contained area.&quot;

&quot;That’s what you do when cancer shows up. You show it the way out! It is a tough phase to be in, but then I would have never known my own strength, which is inherent in each one of us, and which we come to know off when tested. Like I said before, let’s choose to be the heroes of our own drama of life. I strongly believe if an obstacle comes in your life it is for you to deal with it, overcome it, beat the shit out of it and become a better version of yourself, which could be a bit worn out but would be experienced, a bit tattered but more wise, a bit left out but more to bring forth, a bit handicapped but better equipped!
So now the upgraded version of myself is dealing with cancer stage 1 a, which is still a result of early detection. I’ll be going through 12 sessions of chemotherapy. 6 down, and another 6 left. Hence the cap look nowadays.
This post is dedicated to my journey where half the battle is won and the other half I want to fight with each of you who is enduring it. Be resilient, be strong, we shall overcome and how! Also I have immense gratitude for people around me who have taken it in the right spirit and didn’t give up on me.&quot;
Tahira and Ayushmann have two children, Virajveer and Varushka. In an interview with IANS, Ayushmann had opened up about his equation with Tahira and how happy he was to have her in his life. &quot;I am glad I have a partner like Tahira who is very brave, strong, who is an inspiration. I have started seeing life through a different prism.&quot;
We hope they both find light at the end of the tunnel.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
