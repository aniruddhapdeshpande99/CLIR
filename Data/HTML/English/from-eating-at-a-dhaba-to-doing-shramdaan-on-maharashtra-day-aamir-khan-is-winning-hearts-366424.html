From Eating At A Dhaba To Doing 'Shramdaan' On Maharashtra Day, Aamir Khan Is Winning Hearts!
On Maharashtra Day and May day on Wednesday, Bollywood actor-producer Aamir Khan indulged in a voluntary contribution of labour in the state's Koregaon Taluka of Satara district, along with his wife Kiran Rao.
You must be living under a rock if you are unaware of the fact that the actor has been extensively towards improving the water situation in Maharashtra through his NGO Paani Foundation.
Today, he took to social media on Wednesday to share photos of him and his wife Kiran Rao. Apart from enjoying a quick little break.
Khan took to his social media accounts to share pictures of him and Kiran eating ‘bhel puri’ off a newspaper and drinking sugarcane juice at a local ‘dhaba’ in Zhawadarjun, a village in Maharashtra.
The couple also posed with the staff of the dhaba as everyone flashed smiles for the pictures. Both Aamir and Kiran were accompanied by Jalamitras who came forward to help Aamir and his non-profitable organisation, Paani Foundation.
