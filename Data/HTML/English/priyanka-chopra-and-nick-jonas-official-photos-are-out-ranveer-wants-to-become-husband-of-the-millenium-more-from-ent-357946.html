PC & Nick Photos Are Out, Ranveer Wants To Become Husband Of The Millenium & More From Ent.
All Hail NickYanka! A long-distance courtship, a lot of rumours, a beautiful proposal – two months after getting engaged and officially announcing their relationship, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas’ love story has finally come to its righteous end. The lovebirds are officially man and wife now! It was the wedding of the year!
Did you know he was tagged as the &ldquo;boyfriend of the millennium&rdquo;! He has supported Deepika Padukone at every step. Forgetting her past and letting bygones be bygones, Ranveer doesn’t even mind hanging out with her former boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor. He, for sure, redefines goals.
&ldquo;I think you just know when you want to spend the rest of your life with that one person – and he’s everything rolled into one man. He’s my best friend, playmate, companion and confidant. I can be silly in front of him, I can be stupid in front of him, I can be sick in front of him, I can be whatever I want to be.&rdquo;
I now see it (the breakup) as a blessing because I was able to recognize my patterns, thought processes and things that I had been so sure of my whole life. I could see them from a whole different perspective,&rdquo;
The report added that Priyanka's brother Siddharth told him the Hindu wedding rituals to Nick Jonas. After Siddharth explained him the significance of saath pheras, Nick was in awe of the ritual that he was completely spell-bound.
