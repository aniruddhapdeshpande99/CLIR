In Bridges' speech, he included &quot;trim tabs&quot; on ocean liners that hinted at all the possibilities of how individuals can make a difference.
In his address, Bridges likened his life and career to that of a trim tab -- a small feature on boats and airplanes that assists in controlling the direction of the vessel. &quot;I like to think of myself as trim tab, and all of us trim tabs,&quot; he said. &quot;We may not seem like we're up to the task, but we are. We're alive! We can make a difference. We can turn this ship in the way we want to go, toward love, toward creating a healthy planet for all of us,&quot; he added.
Joining the list of recipients of Cecil B. DeMille Award like Walt Disney, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Robin Williams, Meryl Streep and last year's honoree, Oprah Winfrey, this one's surely a big achievement.
Needless to say, his speech got a big thumbs up from the audience.
