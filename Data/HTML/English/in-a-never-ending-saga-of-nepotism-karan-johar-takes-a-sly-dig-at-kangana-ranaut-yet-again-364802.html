All thanks to Kangana Ranaut for coming to Karan Johar’s chat show Koffee With Karan and calling the host - the &ldquo;flag-bearer of nepotism.&rdquo; Since then, there hasn’t been a conclusive end to this debate in Bollywood.
There was a war of words between Kangana Ranaut and Karan Johar, and a lot of other celebrities expressed their views on the hot topic as well. She was mocked at an award function after Karan along with Saif Ali Khan and Varun Dhawan hailed &ldquo;nepotism rocks&rdquo; on the stage of the show. Later on, he apologised for his quip.
Now, at YouTube fan fest, Karan Johar was once again presented with the same question by Bhuvan Bam during an interaction. He was asked why he loves the term nepotism. To this, here’s what Karan Johar said.
