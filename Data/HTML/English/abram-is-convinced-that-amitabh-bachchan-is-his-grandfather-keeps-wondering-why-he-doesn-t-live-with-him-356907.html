Children are beautiful. These innocent souls always bring a smile upon our faces, don’t they?
So last year when Shah Rukh Khan’s little munchkin AbRam had met with Amitabh Bachchan on Aaradhya Bachchan’s birthday, he was mesmerised with the legendary star. So much so, that he evidently enjoyed his company, and he even thought Big B was his grandfather, as revealed by Shah Rukh Khan.
Thank u sir. This is a moment he will always cherish. By the way he thinks u r my ‘papa’ when he sees u on TV. https://t.co/2WUiFPAEWy — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) November 20, 2017
Amitabh Bachchan who has played Shah Rukh Khan’s father in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham had a wonderful time meeting the tiny tot again on Aaradhya Bachchan’s birthday this year as well.
