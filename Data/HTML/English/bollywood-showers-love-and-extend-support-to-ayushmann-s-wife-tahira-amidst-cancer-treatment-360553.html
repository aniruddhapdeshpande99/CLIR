While this was something they may have never imagined but that hasn't deterred or stopped Tahira from chasing her dreams or leading a normal life.
Tahira is an inspiration in the true sense and we have yet another example. Just one day ago, she shared a picture of her shaved head and she shared a strong message about self-love.
She wrote,

&quot;Thatâ€™s a new me with the old self! Was getting tired of the extensions, so this is how it is and itâ€™s so liberating in every sense of the word, so much so that I donâ€™t have to duck the shower while bathing or while picking up the soap! I never thought I had go bald, was stretching my time with the good olâ€™ cap for too long. But this feels so good&quot;
That's not all. Like a doting husband that he is, Ayushmann had the sweetest thing to say about Tahira's post about shaving her head and self-love.
That's not all. Ayushmann's friends from the film fraternity showered love and deemed her as an inspiration.
