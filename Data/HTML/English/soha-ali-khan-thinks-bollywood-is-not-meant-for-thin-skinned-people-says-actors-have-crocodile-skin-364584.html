&ldquo;Most actors have crocodile skin and most people on social media, I think have crocodile skin. Because if you post something on social media and actually read the comments, some people will just be destroyed, but then you get used to it and like most human beings do, you adapt.&rdquo;

It’s your own happiness that matters in the end, she says. &ldquo;You tend to realise that you can't make everyone happy and the most important person you need to make happy is yourself.
With superstars’ Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan’s movies failing at the box office last year, everyone has been asking if the age of stardom is gone. When Soha was asked if stardom comes with an expiry date and has this thought ever struck her mind, she said:
&ldquo;No, life comes with an expiry date and stardom cannot be taken seriously because honestly when you go, you are not going to take your awards with you or your money with you. I mean people say that you leave behind something but I have seen enough famous people being forgotten and not being taken seriously&rdquo;.&rdquo;
Don’t sacrifice a lot for stardom, she says. &ldquo;If stardom makes you happy, great, but if it makes you unhappy then maybe you need to re-look at things&rdquo;.
Talking about her own career, Soha Ali Khan said that she wanted more opportunities. She thinks she wasn’t tapped fully as an actor.
