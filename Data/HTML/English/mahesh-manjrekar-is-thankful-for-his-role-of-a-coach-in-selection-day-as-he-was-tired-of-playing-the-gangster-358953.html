We're talking about Mahesh Manjrekar, the man who can make bad look good.
But this time, he's playing the good guy and couldn't be more grateful. Mahesh Manjrekar will next be seen in a web series, Selection Day, where he plays the role of a coach to a boys' cricket team.

Speaking exclusively to Indiatimes, Mahesh said, &quot;I was tired of playing the same roles. There were same fixed expressions I used to carry from home and I was done. So this was a great opportunity, thanks to the web show, there are now roles which are written and thought of. Selection Day and Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota are some of the roles which are defined and I enjoyed playing an important part in the series. This was truly a blessing day in disguise.&quot;

Since Bollywood caters to mostly masala potboilers, Mahesh feels web shows are definitely meant for the informed audience and better filmmakers.
&quot;Bollywood filmmakers have a formula and they have a set list. Even if 90 percent of their 'kind of films' flop, they still believe only those masala films do well. But today, the audience is ready to see something which is done sensibly. Now thankfully corporates have ventured into the cinema, instead of individual producers.
You want to know what these fixed formats are?
According to the actor, some movie makers think three action scenes, 1 comedy scene, 1 rape scene and 1 vamp ka song is the way to a successful film. But with web based shows, that has gone out of the window and he's glad the focus has shifted.
Mahesh Manjrekar's cricket show Selection Day premieres on November 28, 2018 on Netflix.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
