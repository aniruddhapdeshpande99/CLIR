Just recently, Irrfan Khan was spotted at the Mumbai airport by the paps. He was hiding his face because reportedly he didn’t wish to be clicked. If reports are to be believed, he had returned to India last month.
&ldquo;The end of the world might be coming soon, but at least he’s in love with somebody and knows who he is — and then comes a sledgehammer,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by Entertainment Weekly.

&ldquo;People will see he has a target he wants to kill, and you will find out who that is. There's also that moment [in season 5, episode 8 'Hardhome'] when Jon Snow was on the boat and the Night King looked at him and raised his arms – there's a similar and even stronger moment between Jon and the Night King this time,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by Entertainment Weekly.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
