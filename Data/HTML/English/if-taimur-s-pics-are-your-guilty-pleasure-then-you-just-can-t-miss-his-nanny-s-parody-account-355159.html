Also, we know you’re not asking about it, but let us tell you that that the basic salary of Taimur’s nanny is Rs 1.50 lakh per month, as per the reports. And it can go upto Rs. 1.75 lakhs depending on the extra hours she works.
And this, my friend, is more than the salary of the PM of our nation -- which is 1.60 Lakh, per month, as revealed by an RTI filed in 2012.
