Kangana has already lashed out at Bollywood A-listers plenty of times but during this movement too, she left no stone unturned. Speaking about Hrithik Roshan to a leading publication, Kangana said,
Whatever is happening with Vikas Bahl is absolutely correct. Our industry still has a lot of people who don't behave well with women. They assault them, they harass them, they should also be punished&rdquo;
&ldquo;People who keep their wives as trophies and keep young girls as their mistresses should also be punished,&rdquo; she told Zee News in an interview.

Funnily, a few days ago, Kailash Kher had lashed out at the Tanushree Dutta-Nana Patekar episode and called it &quot;meaningless&quot;
&quot;This is a meaningless issue for me. I believe if two people are fighting there are institutions made for the purpose; they have legal recourse available for them. If others talk about such issues, they are just trying to act smart. I am not born to do meaningless talk.&quot;
8. Bhushan Kumar
Dailyhunt
After many A-listers have been taken down on social media for sexual misbehaviour, another one bites the dust. An actress has anonymously accused T-Series head honcho Bhushan Kumar of propositioning her during talks for a three-film deal with his banner 3 years ago. woman.
&quot;I met him for the first time in his office, it was a formal meeting and everything was finalised verbally and papers were to be signed the next day,&quot; her account on Twitter read.
The next morning, she received a text from him asking to meet at his bungalow that evening. When she expressed her reservations, he messaged her saying that he was &quot;looking for a relationship that involves work and pleasure&quot; and he could make her a &quot;superstar&quot; if she agreed to his proposition.
Needless to say, she lost the contract.
9 Rajat Kapoor
After Nana Patekar, Chetan Bhagat and Kailash Kher, another name that has been accused of sexual harassment is Rajat Kapoor. He has been accused of asking questions such as 'Are you as sexy as you sound?'. Not just that, he also inquired about the girl's body measurements.
