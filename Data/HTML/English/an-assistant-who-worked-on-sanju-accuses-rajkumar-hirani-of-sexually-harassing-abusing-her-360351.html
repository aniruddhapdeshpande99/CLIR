Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani has been accused of sexual assault by a woman who worked with him on his 2017 film Sanju.
Hirani has categorically denied the allegations.
In an article on HuffPost India, the woman, who calls herself as &quot;an assistant&quot;, alleged that Hirani sexually abused her more than once between March and September 2018.

Here's what happened:
1. She detailed her allegations in an email dated November 3, 2018, to Hirani's longtime collaborator and &quot;Sanju&quot; co-producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The woman said that on April 9, 2018, the director first passed a sexually suggestive remark to her and later sexually assaulted her at his home office.
2. &quot;I remember forming these words on my lips - 'Sir, This is wrong. Because of this power structure. You being the absolute power and me being a mere assistant, a nobody - I will never be able to express myself to you',&quot; she wrote of the April 9 incident in the email to Chopra, as quoted by HuffPost India.
3. The woman said that Hirani was a father figure for her. &quot;My mind, body and heart were grossly violated that night and for the next 6 months,&quot; the email read.

4. Chopra's wife, film critic Anupama, who is a director at Vinod Chopra Films Pvt Ltd, &quot;Sanju&quot; scriptwriter Abhijat Joshi and filmmaker Shelly Chopra, Vidhu Vinod's sister, were also marked on the email. The complainant later spoke to HuffPost India that she was &quot;intimidated by Hirani&quot;, who was her reporting person at the time. She said she maintained a facade of normalcy regarding Hirani's behaviour as she needed to hold on to her job as her father was suffering from a terminal illness. &quot;I had no choice but to be polite to him. It was unbearable but the reason I endured it all, until I couldn't, was because I didn't want my job to be taken away from me, and work to be questioned. Ever. &quot;I was worried that if I left midway, it would be impossible to find another job in this industry if he were to speak badly about my work. Because if Hirani said I wasn't good, everybody would listen. My future would be in jeopardy,&quot; she said.
5. Anupama Chopra had confirmed that the woman had shared an account with her, and that Vinod Chopra Films (VCF) has since set up a committee to address complaints of sexual harassment. &quot;I have offered my full support and recommended that she take the complaint to a legal body or a neutral party since we cannot be arbitrators or judges on this.&quot;We also offered to set up an ICC at VCF (which we have set up since then) even though a VCF ICC could not have taken up the case since she was an RHF (Rajkumar Hirani Films) employee at the time. These are two separate companies,&quot; she said in an email dated December 5, 2018.
6. Anupama said the woman told her she needed time to think about how to take things forward. She added, &quot;I did not want in any way to pressurize her or steer her in any direction. As Vinod and I told her then, she has our full support and we are fully respectful of whatever decision she has taken.&quot;
The development comes close on the heels of Hirani's name been dropped from the new poster and trailer of &quot;Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga&quot;, directed by Shelly Chopra. A still from the film's teaser, which released on 27 June, 2018, carried Hirani's name as co-producer.
While, Vidhu Vinod Chopra has not yet commented, His lawyer Anand Desai termed the allegations &quot;false, mischievous, scandalous, motivated and defamatory&quot;.

After people like Nana Patekar, Alok Nath, Vikas Bahl, Sajid Khan and former Union minister MJ Akbar, Hirani is another shocking addition in the #MeToo storm.
