Itâ€™s hard and stupid to miss this one, to be honest.

The frenzy of the Avengers: Endgame is such that the pre-ticket sales have set a record already. People are re-selling the tickets on eBay for almost Rs 6,35,260. Donâ€™t believe us? Read this.

What will happen in the movie, everyone is wondering, but some of the people have already watched it. Not entirely, of course, but just 10 minutes of it. No, it hasnâ€™t been leaked. Ten minutes of Avengers: Endgame was screened for the press head of the filmâ€™s Los Angeles press junket on Friday.

The reactions are ecstatic. People have given it an 'A plus' rating. Whatâ€™s more? The spoilers are all over the internet.

Ok. Ok ok. So I saw two (mind you short) scenes from @Avengers on the Lot today for an event for @Attractions. Couldnâ€™t have been more than 8 minutes of footage. And I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN I EVEN DID BEFORE. â€” Tiffany Mink (@minkus) April 6, 2019

If this opening scene is playing out how it LOOKS like itâ€™s playing out. Yo. I can at least say this- in the span of less than that 8 minutes, I went from actual crying to cheering. This thing is going to be W I L D. #avengersendgame â€” Tiffany Mink (@minkus) April 6, 2019
Yâ€™ALL REALLY TRYING TO START OFF THE MOVIE LIKE THAT?!?!?!?!?!

I have now screened #AvengersEndgame footage and all I can say is that you are not prepared for what's coming. Endgame is going to be craaazzzyyyyy! pic.twitter.com/WR99AafXik â€” Yolanda Machado (@SassyMamainLA) April 6, 2019
Just saw about 10 minutes of #avengersendgame at @DisneyStudios. The first 5 minutes was what appeared to be the beginning of the movie and the second 5 minutes was what I had previously seen at #CinemaCon. Not allowed to say anything specific but if I had to grade the footage A+ pic.twitter.com/tgSYMU1kKy â€” Steven Weintraub (@colliderfrosty) April 6, 2019
We saw about 6-7 minute of Avengers Endgame. One part was the CinemaCon footage, another wasnâ€™t, both left my dying to see more and with a million more questions. Some of which I can ask this weekend. â€” Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) April 6, 2019
Just finished screening some of the footage from #AvengersEndgame!The Russoâ€™s showed us 2 clips. Loved what I saw. Iâ€™m 10x times more excited for the movie now pic.twitter.com/YXKlDOqw6x â€” Dorian Parks (@DorianParksnRec) April 6, 2019
I saw some #AvengersEndgame footage tonight. Iâ€™d rather let you see it for yourself than describe it in detail. It was simultaneously tragic and sweet. Iâ€™m beyond impressed and Iâ€™ve got even more questions now than I had going in. Canâ€™t wait to see the rest! pic.twitter.com/aOQRBfZLBO â€” Sean Gerber (@MrSeanGerber) April 6, 2019
Of course, Marvel is not screening the entire film ahead of the release, just like they didnâ€™t screen Avengers: Infinity War. During his visit to India, director Joe Russo appealed to the audiences to not reveal the spoilers after they have watched the movie. He said that keeping the plot of the film under wraps is very important, and hence, he didnâ€™t even answer any questions related to the plot.
However, GameSpot has offered some concrete details after having watched 10 minutes of the movie. Of course, we are not going to spoil it for you. But discussions on Twitter are on!
You are not prepared for whatâ€™s coming, are you? Avengers: Endgame is hitting the screens in India on April 26.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
