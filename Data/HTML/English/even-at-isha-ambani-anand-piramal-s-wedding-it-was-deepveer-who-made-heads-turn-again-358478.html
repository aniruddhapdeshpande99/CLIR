Even At Isha Ambani-Anand Piramal's Wedding, It was DeepVeer Who Made Heads Turn. Again!
Their own wedding celebrations might be over but Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone are in celebratory mood. After pre-wedding celebrations of Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal in Udaipur, Ranveer and Deepika attended the wedding ceremony of the couple in Mumbai last night.
The newlyweds were seen smiling, holding hands and posing for the paps last night and one thing that has always remained consistent is how they are so protective of each other in public. A car almost touched Deepika last night, when Ranveer Singh and her bodyguard Jalal stopped the moving car.

While the couple of the evening was Anand and Isha, it was DeepVeer who stole our hearts again with their romantic and sweet gestures for each other.
