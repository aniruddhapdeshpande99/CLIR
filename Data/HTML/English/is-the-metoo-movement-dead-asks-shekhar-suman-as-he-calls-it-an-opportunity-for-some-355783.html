It reached India too, after Tanushree Dutta once again accused Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her about ten years ago and revealing that it led her to quitting Bollywood for good. Right after this big revelation, a domino effect was recorded that led to one woman after the other to call out the sexual predators who harassed them at some point.

But in the same breath i dont blindly support it...i said it shld not be gender specific.wen adhyayan spoke about it he was shamed n ridiculed.where as wen the victim was a woman she was idolized.
The predator must be punished whether man or woman. — Shekhar Suman (@shekharsuman7) October 30, 2018
Shekhar Suman’s son Adhyayan Suman was one amongst those who spoke on the ongoing movement. Adhyayan, who was reportedly dating Kangana Ranaut in the past, alleged that when he spoke about the harassment that he faced, he was not only shunned but also criticised.
#MeToo is a movement empowering men and women alike to come out in the open and speak up. My tweets were a way of reaching out to all the people who wanted to be heard and not to gain any publicity in this hot debacle.
I spoke up 2 years ago and I was shunned , criticised on — adhyayen suman (@AdhyayanSsuman) October 13, 2018
Wen Adhyayan spoke up 2 yrs ago ppl said he did it for publicity bcoz he had a failed career,though he was fairly well known.Wat about all the girls coming out and speaking up now?some of them unknown n with no careers.Are they doing it for publicity too? — Shekhar Suman (@shekharsuman7) October 15, 2018
