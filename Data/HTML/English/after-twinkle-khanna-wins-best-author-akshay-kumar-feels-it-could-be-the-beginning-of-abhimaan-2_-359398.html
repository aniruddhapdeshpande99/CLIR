After Twinkle Khanna Wins Best Author, Akshay Kumar Feels It Could Be The Beginning Of Abhimaan 2
We have all seen the cult movie Abhimaan which featured Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan back in 1973. The film revolves around hero's jealousy when his wife becomes more successful than him.

While that was reel life, these things have been witnessed in real life as well. However, in due course of time, things have changed over the years. Today, husbands are not jealous of their partner's achievements rather proud. And the classic example is our Bollywood A-lister Akshay Kumar.

Well, looks like Twinkle's humour is being rubbed off on Akshay Kumar. The husband certainly is super proud of his wife and one more time this witty couple has given us marriage goals.
