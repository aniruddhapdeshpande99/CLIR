&quot;It has been a most satisfying experience to give some to them our countrymen that sacrificed their lives for us... 44 families diversified into 112 entities were given out in my small way from Maharashtra, the brave hearts , the SHAHEED. More needs to be done from other parts of the country too. It shall be done. Over 350 farmers loans that were difficult to pay off, and to prevent them from committing suicide, was paid off some days back too... Earlier farmer loans from Andhra and Vidarbha had been done... Now a list of over 850 farmers from Uttar Pradesh have been identified and their loans amounting to over Rs 5.5 crore shall be taken care of... The assistance from the bank in question assists in its execution and its benevolence.&quot;
