The date 15th November is very special for the couple and not just because they're tying the knot, but also because their first film together Goliyon Ki Raasleela-Ramleela too released on 15th November 2013. And after five years of the film and six years of officially being together, this blockbuster love-story found its happy ending in the romantic city of Italy.
