These crackers were only exploding ... The explosion was creating the pollution to get disbursed which we see as smoke... The crackers were smokeless...

I think #PriyankaChopra should be awarded with Bharat Ratna to invent environment friendly and dog friendly crackers for #NickyankaKiShaadi #NationalPollutionControlDay pic.twitter.com/U3inYsUYxH — Salman Abdi (@SalmanAabdi) December 2, 2018
#PriyankaChopra If you want to give out a message to your fans to not burst crackers on Diwali bec it affects the environment, animals, asthma patients then the same rules apply to your wedding. It's important to practice what you preach! https://t.co/T3ZWph66pY — Rohit Khilnani (@rohitkhilnani) December 2, 2018
