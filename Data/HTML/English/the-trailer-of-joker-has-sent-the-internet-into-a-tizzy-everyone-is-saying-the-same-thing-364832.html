I gotta say, I wasn’t sure on how I felt about a Joker origin movie... however having said that, Joaquin Phoenix’s performance is clearly going to be incredible. And the dude NAILED that laugh. This made me way more excited than I ever thought it would. https://t.co/Td7SicdaLV — Mario Piacquadio (@MarioNotBros) April 3, 2019

Not gonna like that Phoenix looks incredible in this trailer. But an origin story of the Joker is not high on the list of things I want in the world. https://t.co/amghyQy6I3 — Jamie Greene (@theroarbots) April 3, 2019
