Come to think of it, these are only the cases that were reported. When I heard the story, I was excited about it and took it to Ekta Kapoor (producer), she loved the concept and even added to the humour quotient of the film by bringing in some writers on board. When we narrated the script to Parineeti (Chopra), she loved it and quickly came on board. Marjavaan’s backdrop is the underbelly of Mumbai. It is an intense action film, which revolves around a love story. I haven’t done massy and masala films before, so this was a new experience.&quot;
