&ldquo;For the female lead, we needed someone who could portray two contrasting personalities with ease and Janhvi stood out, she really connected with the script. Her talent is still raw, but she is excited about being moulded. The script is young, refreshing and totally crazy, and she is exactly that,&rdquo; producer Dinesh Vijan said in a statement as quoted by PTI.

The story of the movie revolves around a singing ghost who puts grooms to sleep so it can possess their brides. Every time there is a wedding in town, local women come together to keep the groom awake through the first night in a bid to avoid the wrath of the ghost.

Janhvi will be seen playing the two poles-apart characters of Roohi and Afsana. Co-producer Mrighdeep Singh Lamba says Janhvi is perfect for the role. &ldquo;She needed to oscillate between two characters which are poles apart. You will fall in love with her in one scene and won't believe she is the same girl in the next one. It's not an easy switch for an actor. It's the perfect casting,&rdquo; he said.
The film will be shot in Uttar Pradesh and will be released on March 20, 2020.
