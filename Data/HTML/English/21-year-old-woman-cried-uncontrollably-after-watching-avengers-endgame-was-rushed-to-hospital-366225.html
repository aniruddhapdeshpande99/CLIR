After watching the surprise and dramatic end to the Avengers: Endgame, this woman reportedly named Xiaoli, began to hyperventilate. So much so, that she was facing difficulty while breathing, her hands and feet were numb, and she couldnâ€™t even stretch out her fingers. She was rushed to the hospital immediately.
&ldquo;I saw that the patient had been breathing heavily, and according to the description from her peers, we thought that her crying had caused hyperventilation. We immediately gave her oxygen and relaxed her emotions by appeasement, reducing her hyperventilation symptoms,&rdquo; one of the emergency doctors was quoted as saying by China News.
