One actor, who managed to leave a meaningful impact and create a difference with Television is Aamir Khan.
Aamir Khan's Satyamev Jayate was a show that en-cashed his star-power in an apt manner to raise awareness around some of the least talked-about but relevant social causes.

But what went behind making of the show that went on to become a successful show? Well, not many know that the show took a toll on Aamir's mental health. In a recent interview with PTI, Aamir Khan revealed that filming his talk show Satyamev Jayate was such a &ldquo;traumatic&rdquo; experience for him he had to consult a doctor by the end of the first season.
Just to jog your memory a little, the show focuses on sensitive social issues prevalent in the country, from female foeticide, child sexual abuse to honour killings.
A PTI report quoted the Dangal actor as saying,

&ldquo;Going through that entire journey of the first season was very traumatic for me. To the extent, I had become emotionally very brittle, I was in very bad shape. At the end of the one year, I could not go out. For absolutely no reason at all, I would just break down.&quot;
Khan further added that it troubled him more as he isn’t trained in distancing himself while listening to people’s emotional turmoil. He adds,

&ldquo;I was an emotional wreck. I also got some help from a doctor. It was just very... (tough) because I am not trained to listen to emotional issues of people and keep a distance. I am not able to do that.&rdquo;
Recalling one of the guests on Satyamev Jayate narrated how he lost his son in a road rage, where he was beaten to death, Aamir said he couldn’t help but think of his son Junaid. Confessing his insecurities and fear as a father, he added,
&ldquo;I was thinking what if someone does that to my son, how will I feel? I used to always put myself in that person’s shoes. As a result it took a big toll on me emotionally.&rdquo;
However, he added that the talk show made him a better person.

&ldquo;I saw the country and people in a way I had never seen because I’ve lived a very sheltered life. It was an enriching journey for me. I learnt a lot and met some amazing persons who made me grow as an individual.&rdquo;
Aamir spoke about the same at a session ‘Giving Matters’ at NASSCOM Technology and Leadership Forum.
