For about 800 years, Notre Dame Cathedral stood tall. The historical church in Paris, however, was engulfed in fire on Monday and it was heartbreaking for everyone to see it burning to the ground.
As the colossal fire swept through the historical monument causing a spire to collapse and threatening to destroy the entire masterpiece and its precious artworks, most of the people were in tears – some others offering prayers.

The cause of the fire is unknown as of yet but officials say it could be linked to renovation work at the heritage structure, the BBC reported. No deaths have been reported so far. However, to see the house of worship being engulfed in flames and huge clouds of grey smoke billowing into the Paris sky, it was startling and sad for the onlookers.
