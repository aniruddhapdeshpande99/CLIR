PM Narendra Modi’s Biopic To Release On April 12, One Day After First Phase Lok Sabha Elections
Election season is around the corner and almost everything has been embroiled in the controversies pertaining to it. When Uri: The Surgical Strike, The Accidental Prime Minister and Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi was released, a lot of people critiqued the movies on the basis of politics surrounding it. Several parties claimed the movies were propagandas.

Strangely, all such movies based on the subject of politics are releasing right before or around the political season. Are they adding spice and melodrama to the upcoming 2019 General elections?

The voting of Lok Sabha elections will take place between April 11 and May 19. The fact that the movie will be released on April 12 has raised a lot of eyebrows already.
Oh! Now Narendra Modi's biopic will be released on 12th April, 2019 during one of the peak months of election. Another propaganda!https://t.co/4QGS5xbg35 — Sunshine_🏵 (@nayak_avni) March 15, 2019

Hello, @vivekoberoi since you are portraying the biggest incompetent man India has ever seen, in his biopic, you might want to go and clean Ganga river all by yourself, so at least in the movie you can say Modi cleaned Ganga. What say? — Tweets of the Ancient Mariner (@tweetmusmaximus) March 15, 2019
Apart from Vivek Oberoi, Darshan Kumaar, Boman Irani, Zarina Wahab, Manoj Joshi, Prashant Narayanan, Barkha Bisht Sengupta, Akshat R Saluja, Anjan Shrivastav, Rajendra Gupta and Yatin Karyekar will be seen playing prominent roles in the movie, which is titled PM Narendra Modi.
Speaking about the cast, producer Sandip Ssingh had earlier said, &quot;A solid star cast with talented actors is the base of an effective cinematic experience. With 'PM Narendra Modi' we have got actors who are not just experienced but are also the right mix for a prestigious project like a biopic on Mr Narendra Modi. I am excited at the prospect of having such a talented cast and to work with them along with Omung.&quot;
PM Narendra Modi will traverse the journey of PM Modi from his humble beginnings to his years as Chief Minister onto his landmark win at the 2014 election and finally being nominated as the Prime Minister of India.
