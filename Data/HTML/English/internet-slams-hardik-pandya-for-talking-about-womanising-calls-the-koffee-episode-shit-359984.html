From a lot of debutantes making their debut on KJo's show, there was a cricketer special episode as well. Yesterday, Cricketers Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul‚Äôs made their debut on Koffee With Karan debut and sadly, the show has backfired and how.

The episode hasn't gone down too well with the audience as when they were asked to choose the better batsman among Indian skipper Virat Kohli and master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, both chose Virat over Sachin. A fan wrote,
Star India
&ldquo;I mean, are you guys who say Virat is better than Sachin really cricket fans or mere accountants? B***** one straight drive by Sachin is more beautiful and valuable than any shot ever hit by Virat&rdquo;
That's not all.
Fans were also shocked by Hardik Pandya's views on womanizing and more.
Here is the internet's verdict on last night's episode.
A thread on all the creepy, misogynist, racist, and problematic things Hardik Pandya said on Koffee With Karan:
1) KJo: Why don't you ask women's names at nightclubs?
HP: I like to watch and observe how they move. I'm little from the Black side so I need to see how they move. ‚Äî Sreeparna Mazumder (@Sreeep) January 6, 2019

#HardikPandya n #KLRahul
Fools they are.
No doubt #Virat is a good player but #Sachin is always on top on any day. No one can match or can reach Sachinüôèüèª#KoffeeWithKaran #KoffeeWithCricketers https://t.co/njOEjnlcNy ‚Äî Shruti (@proud_2beIndian) January 7, 2019
Sachin is second to none. He's the GOD. He's an emotion. Bigger than Cricket. The undisputed no.1 GOAT!

Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul on #KoffeeWithKaran happened to be the most cringe-worthy episode. #KoffeeWithCricketers was pure SH*T in a coffee mug. ‚Äî Anoop Tomer (@anooptomer) January 7, 2019
After watching today's episode of #KoffeeWithKaran, it's not hard to understand why cricket isn't cool anymore. #KoffeeWithCricketers ‚Äî MSD7782 (@msd7782) January 6, 2019
#KoffeeWithCricketers was just the worst episode. What's up with all the #misogyny . Tired of this boys will be boys attitude. @klrahul11 @hardikpandya7 #KoffeeWithKaran ‚Äî Ekta Chauhan (@ekta2993) January 7, 2019
Watched #KoffeeWithCricketers
And I must say #HardikPandya is one pathetic, over-rated guy. He tries too much to be cool but he is not at all. Neither he is good looking nor a good human being.
On the other hand @klrahul11
Is a true gentleman. ‚Äî vinay pandey (@feelvinay) January 6, 2019
#KoffeeWithCricketers Hardik Pandya should be dropped. He thinks he's West Indian. Some people cant handle money and fame. Sick. ‚Äî pranit malik (@pranitmalik) January 6, 2019
