Deepika’s role of an acid attack victim has been inspired by Lakshmi Agarwal, who after going through a lot of hardships is now leading her life with courage and bravery. Deepika who earlier said that she was quite moved by the story is happy to be playing this role.
But who is Lakshmi Agarwal?
For the unversed, Lakshmi Agarwal was 15 years old when she was walking to a bookstore and was attacked by a man who threw acid on her twice. For three months, she was admitted to Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where she underwent multiple surgeries. Her room had no mirrors so she would try to catch a glimpse of her face in the reflection of water.

Furthermore, acid attack was included as a separate offense under IPC (Indian Penal Code) by the passage of a criminal act, 2013.
US State Department’s International Women of Courage Award honoured her in 2013 where then-First Lady Michelle Obama presented her the award.
In 2014, Lakshmi met journalist Alok Dixit, who was also the founder of Stop Acid Attack campaign and the cupid worked its magic. They fell in love but decided not to get married and be in a live-in relationship instead. Why? Because Lakshmi Agarwal didn’t want people to come at her wedding and comment on her looks. Together they co-founded NGO, Chhanv Foundation.
While everything seemed good, soon after their child was born, Lakshmi and Alok parted ways on account of some differences. She was finding it tough to manage her finances. So much so, that she was couldn’t even afford the rent of the two-room flat she was living in, in Delhi’s Lakshmi Nagar.
