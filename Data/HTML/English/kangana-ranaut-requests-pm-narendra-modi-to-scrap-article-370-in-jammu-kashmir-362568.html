Whether it's her reel life or real life, Kangana is known to be bold and brazen and that's what makes her stand out. She takes on Bollywood like no other and has always given her opinions on politics, nepotism among other things without batting an eye lid.

After the success of Manikarnika, Kangana has been touted as the dynamic director-actor, film industry has ever seen. She's unlike any A-lister and some people even call her the Rakhi Sawant of tinsel town.
But you think she cares? Well, certainly not. After lashing out at director Krish, Sonu Sood, Hrithik Roshan, Alia Bhatt and Shabana Azmi in the past, Kangana has now spoken about Pulwama terror attack.

In an interview with National Reporter, Kangana said, &ldquo;It is my sincere request to our Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) that Article 370 should be completely scrapped. I feel that after so many years of Independence, no state in our country should face confusion as to where they belong,&rdquo; Kangana Ranaut said.
Here's Kangana's entire video where she has requested the PM to scrap article 370. The actress even spoke about her take on Pakistani artists' being banned to perform in our country.
For the uninitiated, Article 370 of the Indian constitution is an article that gives autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
