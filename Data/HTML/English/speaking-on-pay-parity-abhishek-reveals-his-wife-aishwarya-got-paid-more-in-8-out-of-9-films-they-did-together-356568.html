&ldquo;It’s a business and if you are a saleable actor, you get paid accordingly. You can’t be a new actress and demand to be paid the same as Shah Rukh Khan,&rdquo; he added.
Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai will next be seen together in Sarvesh Mewara's Gulab Jamun, which will be produced by Anurag Kashyap.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
