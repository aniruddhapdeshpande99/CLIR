When Anupam Kher got to know about this, he lashed out at Rahul Gandhi and his supporters, on Twitter.
Dear @RahulGandhi. I donâ€™t think your supporters who vandalised a theatre playing #TheAccidentalPrimeminister read your tweets about #FreedomOfExpression.ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ https://t.co/bQLPRFJRDJ â€” Anupam Kher (@AnupamPKher) January 12, 2019
Intolerance of the people who pretend to be tolerant. Cong workers vandalise theatre over 'The Accidental...' screening https://t.co/mHGUR2hFLP â€” Anupam Kher (@AnupamPKher) January 12, 2019
As per the latest development, six protestors have been arrested for holding a demonstration against the screening of The Accidental Prime Minister at Quest INOX Cineplex in Kolkata.
The film is based on facts chronicled in a book by Sanjaya Baru - Manmohan Singh's media advisor between 2004 and 2008. It revolves around Singh's life, the economist and politician who served as the Prime Minister of India from 2004 to 2014 under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.
