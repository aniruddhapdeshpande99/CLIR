The fact that these people resemble popular stars takes everyone by surprise, right? And they all instantly rise to fame as well. While we find celebrity doppelgangers amusing, have you ever imagined what it would be like meeting your own look-alike? The thought of it creeps you out, doesn’t it?
So, here, meet Gareebon Ka Ranveer (yeah that’s what he is hailed as) Imran, who is apparently Ranveer Singh’s fan, and Kinjal AKA farzi Deepika Padukone, who are now TikTok superstars – courtesy their viral videos on the app.
Ranveer Singh’s fan Imran has 168.7K followers. He has even mouthed Simmba's dialogue and Gully Boy's rap. Take a look!
On the other hand, Deepika Padukone’s look-alike AKA Kinjal has 202.1K followers.
This is hilarious and shocking at the same time, right?
