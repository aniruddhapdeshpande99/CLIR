Talking about Gully Boy, Ranveer in an interview with us had said, &ldquo;After Padmaavat, I did Gully Boy and completed it and then did Simmba. In Gully Boy, I had to be this quiet boy who deals with a lot of inner emotions. In fact after shooting for a scene, I used to not even see the monitor, we shot the entire film and I didn’t even see one scene of mine, I had no clue about it, after the shooting Zoya went to New York for 6 months for the edit of the film, and just yesterday she showed me the teaser of the film and I was like F***K. It is that crazy, I swear if there would be an actor other than me in this teaser I would be burnt to crisp, I would be damn jealous of that actor. It’s Mumbai, its Hip hop, It’s ME&rdquo;.
If you haven’t seen the teaser then you are definitely missing out. The teaser also features Alia Bhatt and Kalki Koechlin, both the actresses look outstanding and super promising.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
