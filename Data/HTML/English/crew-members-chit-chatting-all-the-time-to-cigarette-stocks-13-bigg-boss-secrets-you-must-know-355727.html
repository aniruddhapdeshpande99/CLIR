Crew Members Chit-Chatting All The Time To Cigarette Stocks, 13 Bigg Boss Secrets You Must Know
While half the country still feels that Bigg Boss is not a classy show to watch, almost everyone watches it in secrecy. When the show airs, all dining table discussions and office gossips also revolve around the same. Don’t we all love to compare each other with our favourite, or rather annoying, contestants on the show? I have personally called a lot of my friends Hina Khan (*wink*).

#2 Hair dryers are not allowed inside the house!
Arshi Khan told us that one of the things that are strictly prohibited to be taken inside the house is Hairdryers. Wondering why? Because they make a lot of noise.

#3 Books including Holy scriptures are not allowed as well.
Of course, if contestants will spend time reading books, how will they entertain the audiences? Arshi Khan said that the contestants are not even allowed to take God’s statues and pictures.

#4 Bigg Boss provides cigarettes on daily basis.
Cigarettes are provided on a daily basis inside Bigg Boss house, says Arshi Khan. Every two-three days, a packet of cigarettes is sent inside the house for all the contestants. Only one person is allowed to smoke at a time inside the smoking area, which apparently doesn’t have any camera. This is done to ensure that no conversation takes place inside the smoking area, because it cannot be aired on TV, since smoking is prohibited on Indian television.

#5 Bigg Boss house has a lot of insects – A LOT OF THEM!
Arshi Khan said that there are a lot of insects inside the house. So much so, that pesticides are sprayed quite regularly.

#6 There is no clock inside the house.
Contestants can’t keep a track of the time inside Bigg Boss house, said Arshi Khan. There is no clock. The wall clock that we have all seen inside the house is non-working and is just adding to the aesthetics, she said.
#7 Contestants wake-up at around 8:00 am and go to sleep at around 11:30.
Arshi Khan said that since there is no clock inside the house, they guess the time on the basis of Azaan that is audible inside the house. According to her, the wake-up alarm in the morning generally rings at 8:30 am and the lights go off at 11:30 pm.
Twitter
#8 Contestants can hear the voice of crew members during the day.
Arshi Khan said that while she was inside the house, she could hear crew members talking the entire day. &ldquo;Pura din crew members ki awaazein aati hain,&rdquo; she said.
#9 Contestants only get basic raw materials for food. Meat, Chicken and Spices including cardamom, depends on the luxury budget.
Arshi Khan said that they get only basic necessities including flour, pulses, milk, salt, sugar, tea and rice among other things inside the house. For chicken, mutton and other spices, they have to depend on luxury budget tasks.

#11 Only the toilets and showers don’t have cameras for obvious reasons.
That’s perhaps why contestants make out inside the loo. Remember Diandra and Gautam Gulati, and also Puneesh and Bandagi were caught entering the bathroom together.
#12 There are A LOT of mirrors inside the house.
But they are simply not mirrors, they have cameras installed behind them. So, when a contestant is looking into the mirror, he/she is actually looking into the camera.

#13 Grapevine suggests Bigg Boss house is haunted.
If grapevine is to be believed, people who have worked on the show experienced paranormal activities. People have experienced a shadow of a woman sitting on their chest, it is said. No one knows how true these rumours are.
