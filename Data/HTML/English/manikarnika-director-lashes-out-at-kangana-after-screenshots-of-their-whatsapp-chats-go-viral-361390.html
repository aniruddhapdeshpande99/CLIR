Manikarnika Director Lashes Out At Kangana After Screenshots Of Their Whatsapp Chats Go Viral

Yes, the movie that had the director Krish and Sonu Sood leave midway has proved that content is ruling the box office. Kangana also fearlessly spoke about the director, sharing screenshots of how she invited Krish to the press screening but he turned down.
Rangoli, Kangana's sister, took to Twitter to share the chats between the two artists.
However, Krish chose to lash back at the sister duo. Sharing his set of screenshots, the filmmaker proved how people who were behind the making the film realised he was a better person to handle the project.

I never thought I've to defend my ability of film making based on the manipulations and lies of one person. @Rangoli_A these messages were ur sister's words about me ehen I've questioned her about the credit and the damage she is doing to the movie. ‚Äî Krish Jagarlamudi (@DirKrish) January 30, 2019
