She was quoted in a PTI report as saying,

&ldquo;I saw ‘Padman’ some months back and came to know about problems faced by girls during the days of their periods. I immediately decided to do something for girls living in villages in India, especially Maharashtra.&quot;
The Class 8 student said she also discussed her idea with Konkan Graduate’s constituency MLC Niranjan Davkhare during his visit to Dubai, and he encouraged her to take it forward.
Talking about the same, Riva added how around Diwali time, she appealed to people in Dubai to donate money for the cause and within a short span. She managed enough sum to buy sanitary pads for 250 girls, she said. The napkins were distributed by the teenager at a function organised by Davkhare’s NGO ‘Samanvay Pratishthan’, which works for social causes.
Davkhare appreciated the girl’s efforts to raise awareness about menstrual hygiene. The report was confirmed after a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator said in a tweet,
&ldquo;Riva Tulpule a 8th Standard student from Dubai, this Diwali decided to do something special & took up an initiative to adopt 250 girls from rural Maharashtra and support them with a full year of Sanitary Pads…&rdquo;
