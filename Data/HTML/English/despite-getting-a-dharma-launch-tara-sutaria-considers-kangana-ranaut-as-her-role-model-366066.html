The actress bashed her colleagues from the fraternity who did not come out to support the film.
Picking Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar, the actress didn't bat an eye lid before slamming them in public for bullying her. Her sister Rangoli Chandel, who is also Kangana's mananger, took to social media to lash out at star kids who have otherwise taken the 'silence' stance. But that did not go down well with Rangoli too.
While whole world propagating speak up or me too Alia ji is going ‚Äò main chup rahoongi aur zulm sahoongi üòÇ How regressive is that, coming from a British girl sounds strange üòú, if you take a leaf from Papa Jo‚Äôs book obviously it will be melodramatic üòÇ ‚Äî Rangoli Chandel (@Rangoli_A) April 23, 2019
But from the film fraternity, one celebrity has no qualms in admitting that Kangana is brave and quite a role model. Dharma launch actress Tara Sutaria. Speaking to an entertainment daily, the actress who is promoting her film Student Of The Year 2, said, 'Kangana has achieved everything on the basis of her talent and without any support whatsoever. And being an upcoming actor, for me, Kangana Ranaut is a role model as she has inspired me.'

An elated Rangoli was quick to acknowledge the praise.
Tara so beautiful and kind ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§, wish you all the best with your debut üòò https://t.co/C416qrLoKQ ‚Äî Rangoli Chandel (@Rangoli_A) April 24, 2019
Student Of The Year is directed by Punit Malhotra and produced by Dharma Productions and we all know the equation KJo and Kangana shared once on the sets of Koffee With Karan. So this statement from Tara comes as a breath of fresh air.
The movie also stars Tiger Shroff, Ananya Pandey and a special appearance by Alia Bhatt. Infact, the Highway actress will be seen grooving alongside Tiger. Speaking about the experience, Tiger, at a promotional event, said,
&quot;We had so much fun shooting the song. Personally, I have never done a dance number like that. Working with Alia was an amazing experience. Though she is such a big star, she was open and cooperative on set while shooting the song,&quot; Tiger told the media in Mumbai on Wednesday.
&quot;She is better than me in this one,&quot; added Tiger, who is known for his dancing skills. For Tiger, who is considered the Indian MJ, this must come across as a huge compliment to Alia. We can't wait to see the dance number</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
