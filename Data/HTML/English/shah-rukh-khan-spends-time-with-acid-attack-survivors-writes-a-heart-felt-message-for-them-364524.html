The survivors of acid attack are brave as well as courageous. However, they do need love and support to be constantly reminded of the fact that beauty isn’t skin-deep.

All of u please put ur hands in prayer...and say Bhagwan inki zindagi ki nayi shuruaat mein...inpar karam karna...May God have mercy on them...Insha Allah. These r my sisters & need ur prayers for recovery, without distinguishing between the mode of prayer https://t.co/JjE8ZM08mX — Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) March 28, 2019
Earlier as well, Shah Rukh Khan in a video had talked about beauty and social acceptance. &ldquo;Beauty is not skin deep, is often said but not really felt. We all need well, but we look away, we shy away from looking at things that are unpleasant, yet we want social acceptance for ourselves, we discriminate from inside, yet we fight for empowerment, yes we all need well, but we do look away,&rdquo; he said in a video.
