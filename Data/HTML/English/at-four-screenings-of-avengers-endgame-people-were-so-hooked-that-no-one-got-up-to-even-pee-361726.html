At Four Screenings Of Avengers Endgame, People Were So Hooked That No One Got Up To Even Pee!
After a tumultuous ending of Avengers: Infinity War, we know we are not ready for Avengers Endgame. But whatever happens, the Marvel universe will never be the same again.
&ldquo;Some people move on. But not us,&rdquo; said the new trailer of Avengers: Endgame that was shared by Marvel studios, a few days ago. Of course, they didn’t spill beans on the plotline, but it sure prepared us emotionally for another roller coaster ride.
Now, building up the excitement even further, directors Joe and Anthony Russo have revealed that they organised test screenings for Avengers: Endgame. Russo Brothers said that the audience was so hooked to the movie that no one got up to even pee.
&ldquo;We have screened the movie four times for audiences now. For the first three screenings, not a single person got up to go to the bathroom,&rdquo; Anthony Russo was quoted as saying in an interview with Collider.
What’s more? They also hinted that the movie will be as long as three hours, but there is still more work to be done in the editing bay.
&ldquo;I think the studio is down with what the best story is. Right now, we think the movie is playing well and we’ve had great responses from our test audiences and we’re feeling very good about where it is. We’re still doing work to it. We’re not done with it.

&ldquo;Again, this is a culmination film of 22 movies, it’s a lot of storytelling to work into it. Emotion is an intrinsic part of that to us. When you have to tell a really complicated story and you want strong emotional moments with the characters, it just requires a certain amount of real estate. This one, in particular, feels like three hours worth of real estate.&rdquo;
Avengers: Endgame is slated to hit the screens on April 26. Are you ready?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
