Just got out of the #AvengersInfinityWar premiere. The movie is incredible, epic beyond compare. It‚Äôs everything you want it to be. Iron Man and Captain America fuck within the first fifteen minutes. Marvel fans are going to love this one - EASILY top five. ‚Äî Ben Mekler (@benmekler) April 24, 2018
In the fake review of Captain Marvel, he wrote, &ldquo;#CaptainMarvel is RADICAL! An awesome 90s period piece & total recalibration of the MCU as we know it! From the brief Winter Soldier cameo to the six full episodes of Friends that play consecutively through a majority of the film‚Äôs runtime, this might be my favorite MCU flick yet.&rdquo;

He even pointed out how a lot of entertainment websites fell for his fake reviews.
But did that stop there? He again posted a fake movie review for Disney‚Äôs Dumbo. &ldquo;#DUMBO soars. My favorite live-action Disney remake yet! From the gorgeous blend of goth and whimsy to the sequence in which Dumbo replaces his trunk with a 32 inch machete and has an affair with a bored housewife, the Tim Burton we know and love is FINALLY back in full force,&rdquo; he wrote.

From Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout to Acquaman, he has tweeted about a lot of other films too.
Thrilled to say #SoloAStarWarsStory WORKS. Cast crushed it - true to what we know yet energetic, fresh. Only subpar thing - at least forty minutes wasted on scenes where characters wolf down raw vidalia onions? Third act drags too. Still, this is a REAL Star Wars movie - loved it ‚Äî Ben Mekler (@benmekler) May 11, 2018
#Aquaman is everything DC fans have been hoping for and more. Rollicking action, an amazing sense of world-building, spellbinding musical numbers in which Aquaman wears clams as tap shoes, and a command performance from Jason Momoa. DC has really righted the ship. The DCEU lives! ‚Äî Ben Mekler (@benmekler) November 26, 2018
Thank you MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT for making me audibly gasp in a theater for the first time in ages. Won‚Äôt soon forget the image of Tom Cruise squeezing pus out of a festering wound while shrieking &ldquo;I have to do this&rdquo; directly into the lens. I. LOVE. THESE. MOVIES. ‚Äî Ben Mekler (@benmekler) July 12, 2018
So, are you looking forward to what he has to say about Avengers: Endgame? Don‚Äôt fall for it!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
