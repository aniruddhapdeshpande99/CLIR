Dayanand Shetty, who plays the role of Daya in the show went on to confirm this news to TOI. The last episode of the show will air on 27th October 2018. In an interview with TOI, Dayanand Shetty said, &quot;We were in our 21st year and had we shot for a few more episodes, we would have entered our 22nd year.
