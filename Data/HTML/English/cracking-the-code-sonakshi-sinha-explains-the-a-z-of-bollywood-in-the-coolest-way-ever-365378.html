Not only on-screen, off-screen as well, Sonakshi Sinha is known for her amiable and cheerful nature, whether it's dealing with her family, fans or the paparazzi. The actress is about to complete a decade in Bollywood and on that occasion, iDiva decided to launch their first ever digital cover with this phenomenal face and we couldn't be more glad.
Speaking about her stardom and the trolls that come along, Sona said, &ldquo;I somehow mastered the art of blocking negativity early in my career. We are in the business where social media plays an important role in our lives and everyone has an opinion they are free to put out there.&quot;

Despite being a star kid herself, Sonakshi is undisturbed with the constant comparisons with her co-stars. &quot;I love doing what I do, and that keeps me going. I get to play exciting characters and meet new people while I'm at it. My biggest learning as an actor has been that you need to keep going. There will be ups and downs which is a part of your profession. The important thing is that you need to stay positive and keep your head on your shoulders and not let your enthusiasm for your work dim. I treat every film like my first film and that's why my work excites me&rdquo;.
Sonakshi also decoded the A-Z of Bollywood and how to deal with trollers like a boss. Take a look.
We assure you, the 'not so mini surprise' at the end of the video will take your breath away. Sonakshi Sinha is all set to conquer our hearts with her upcoming release Kalank.
