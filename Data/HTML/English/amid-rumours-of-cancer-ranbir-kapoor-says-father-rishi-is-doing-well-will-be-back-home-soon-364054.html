Earlier in an interaction with ET, Randhir Kapoor had said, &ldquo;We don't know yet what is the exact nature of his ailment. Rishi himself doesn't know what he's suffering from. He has not even started undergoing tests there; how can people speculate that he has cancer and that too, one that has escalated to advanced stage.&rdquo;
We hope for a speedy recovery for Rishi Kapoor!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
