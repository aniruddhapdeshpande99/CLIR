If you have watched the trailer of the movie, you would know that it shows telephones turning against their users in a post-apocalyptic world. If you haven’t seen the trailer, watch the video below to know more.
&ldquo;Every person who owns a cellphone is a murderer,&rdquo; growls the villain in the movie.
So, offended at this, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) have written a letter to the country’s censor board and government.
