A lot of people say that films such as The Accidental Prime Minister and Uri: The Surgical Strike have propagandas. What’s more? Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s frequent meeting with the Bollywood stars also received quite a lot of backlash.
Modiji, we understand your 'Love Aaj kal' is directed towards Anil Ambani but the youth are unemployed, the farmers are distressed & the economy is in turmoil, so it wouldn't hurt to pay a little more attention to the rest of the country. https://t.co/8KMjGDOro4 — Congress (@INCIndia) January 21, 2019
If this wasn’t enough already, rumours were afloat a couple of days ago that Congress leaders are trying to get Kareena Kapoor as one of their candidates for Lok Sabha Polls. According to reports, her name was suggested by Congress leaders, Guddu Chouhan and Anas Khan, as a potential candidate for Bhopal parliamentary seat, where the party hasn’t tasted success since 1984.
Kareena, however, rubbished the reports saying that her only focus right now is movies.
