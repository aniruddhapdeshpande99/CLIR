Why Game Of Thrones Spoilers Are OK And Not Avengers Endgame? Here's What The Fans Have To Say
War in Yemen, Trump in White House, Rishabh Pant's absence from the World Cup Squad and Game Of Thrones spoilers have all royally pissed off people recently. Oh no -- they got over Yemen? Ignore that then.
Baffling as it may sound, all of these topics evoked comparable reactions, death threats, and abuses -- with the word asshole tossed around generously with no remorse.
I'm not ranting about our completely whacked out moral compass, instead this is about a realisation. We thought the world's divided into those who revelled in spoilers and those who wanted to boil them alive for it, but a string of conversations is making me say otherwise. Turns out spoilers are exactly like people in democracies, and not all of them are created equal.
If you’ve spent some time on Twitter since the release of Avengers Endgame, you will see not many people are tweeting, writing or talking about spoilers.

The overall sense of asshole-ness is much less. Compare this to last week when people got up early on a Monday morning, watched the second episode of Game of Thrones and then tweeted their spoilers immediately on their two hour-odd commute to their Gurgaon office.
Is there a larger logic to this? We decided to lazily crowd source this, since the Indiatimes Whatsapp groups have been ODing on Avengers Endgame since last night (and before that Game of Thrones).
Two amongst them are spectacularly guilty of putting out Game Of Thrones spoilers, one of whom has maintained radio silence on Avengers Endgame ever since watching it on opening night.
Both of them believe they have a good reason for their hypocrisy.
Jayesh Shinde who moonlights as the Indiatimes Tech Editor, a nerd by day and a nutcase putting out GOT spoilers without fail every Monday morning believes it’s just because waiting for GOT to finish by May 20th to put out spoilers is just too long to &ldquo;bottle it all up.&rdquo; He claims he doesn’t mind shutting up about Avengers spoilers because of reasons I can best describe as humanitarian. &ldquo;I'm okay with keeping quiet for a few days more for Endgame because I know there's been a genuine issue with tickets/overbooking/mad scramble etc, and give people who want to see it and enjoy it without spoilers a little more time.&rdquo; Somewhere he does believe his magnanimity justifies his need to put out GOT spoilers.
The reason why I use the Indiatimes team as a microcosm though is that like every other team which comprises mostly of millennials, we’ve all had our fair share of melodrama around spoilers. We have had people weep silently when asked to do stories when Jamie pushes Bran off the tower (Oh yeah, he’s nice now, but he was an asshole, not too long ago), we’ve had people exchange words because one told the other that Fawad Khan played a gay character in Kapoor and Sons. Andhadhun was another powder keg situation.
Bhavya Sadhwani, another one of the GOT spoiler culprits and our entertainment team ninja believes, the &ldquo;logic is that GoT is accessible to everyone unlike Avengers. So even if I would have seen it, I wouldn’t be spoiling it for the rest of us.&rdquo; The saving grace is that she’s not into Avengers as much as she is into GOT.
Abhijit Dey (he doesn’t work for Indiatimes, but judging for how passionately he feels about spoilers he should) believes the reason why people feel less inclined to put out Avengers spoilers is because this is the last movie that comes at the end of a decade long wait. &ldquo;So, there’s an emotional inclination not to ruin the movie for others,&rdquo; Dey says. Plus the #DontSpoilEndgame campaign could have helped, too. Dey has predictably not seen Game Of Thrones.
So, is this purely an outcome of the Avengers or MCU canon being stronger than the Game Of Thrones fantasy epic? The answer (particularly in India) is not black and white. If you use Google Trends as a metric, India continued to have very high traffic for ‘Game Of Thrones’ till April 23rd when Avengers overtook it (we are looking at the last 30 days), it peaked on the next day. The numbers globally are even starker and basically show the Night king is winning over Thanos, at least for now. GOT has seen a peak in India and globally on the launch of both episodes, while Avengers has not.
Twitter
To make things even more exciting, turns out, not everyone seems to have gotten the memo about hanging onto the Endgame spoilers. Siddharth Singh, a writer posted on Twitter &ldquo;While watching #AvengersEndgame, as the movie was about 10 mins in, a random woman from outside our theatre slammed the door open, and screamed out a major spoiler. And then ran away.&rdquo;
Gargi Rawat, a journalist and anchor was apparently accosted by two people on her way to watching Endgame who asked her, if she was there &ldquo;to watch Avengers?&rdquo; and proceeded to helpfully ask her if she wanted to know what happens. She refused, of course. There are a lot of others who confess that others mischievously scream fake spoilers to people going to watch the movie leading them into 2-odd hours of monumental sulks before they realised they’d been pranked.
So it’s clear spoilers are a matter of national importance. And predictably, the conversation goes into the GOT vs MCU Avengers space, as the two strong pillars of fandom headlining pop culture right now.
Rishabh Kapoor who is our resident movie nerd at Indiatimes believes &ldquo;The shared fandom (of MCU aka Avengers) is a lot older and a lot bigger than GoT will ever be. GoT is just a miniscule phenomenon in front of this 70 year old sensation that was quick enough to form a diverse pop culture context on an international level.&rdquo; He’s not seen the Google Trends figures yet, but argues that, &ldquo;MCU kinda gave the near perfect renditions of our favourite comic book characters and they were justified by some best actors so damn well.&rdquo;
Predictably, the chat that started off from why it's ok to give spoilers of one and not the other heads into the GOT vs MCU. Almost as if people are not equally interested in whether or not Night King and icicle breathing Viserion and the Sindhi golden gloved Thanos don’t evoke the same sort of fandom.
GOT vs Avengers Endgame
Mithun Mohandas, who Jayesh describes as the God of Nerds, is a little more balanced. &ldquo;Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy which has a lot more depth to each and every character, their families and whatever's happening in their lives. The writing itself builds a better connect for the audience with each principal character.
This, in turn, gets more people talking about how their story arcs can progress because the writing opens up so many possibilities. The Avengers: Endgame is a mainstream franchise with each movie being extremely short as character arcs must terminate in 2-3 movies which translates to 6-9 hours. Moreover, with the writing being dumbed down to appeal to the mass audience, there's little scope for discussion.&quot;
According to him the spoilers for Game Of Thrones are more than the spoilers for Avengers Endgame purely as a result of the fact that one is still ongoing why the other has wrapped up. &ldquo;There is stuff to discuss with regards to what might happen in the upcoming episodes whereas with Avengers: Endgame, the MCU phase has ended and with that, the potential for discussions has ended as well. At most, we'll see some residual discussion which will be spoilery as more people end up watching the movie but that will die soon,&rdquo; Mohandas says.
There is some logic to what he says, traditionally, there tends to be more discussion about movies and shows which have an open ending. For eg Baahubali inspired a lot more discussion about ‘Katappa Ney Baahubali ko kyun maara’ than Baahubali 2 did. The same question comes up if you think whether Andhadhun would have inspired as much discussion if the ending was clearer. Both Ayushmann as well as the director Sriram Raghavan believe it wouldn’t have. When these discussions collide head-first with our need to share everything, well that’s what spoilers are all about in essence.
Could Game Of Thrones be inspiring more spoilers, just because there’s a lot more to talk about than the Avengers? Either way, give spoilers at your own peril and at the risk of life and limb.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
