&quot;I am not Padma Shri Manoj Bajpayee. I am Manoj Bajpayee, an outsider who saw dreams and stayed on the fringes of Mumbai and worked day and night to get work. For my contribution to Hindi cinema, I was felicitated with Padma Shri. I am happy to get such an honour but it does not mean I will stick around it only,&quot; Manoj told IANS in a telephonic interview.
Bajpayee, who has completed twenty five years in the Indian film industry added,

&quot;It is important to move on from the laurels of the past. I can't let success go to my head. These awards inspire me to do more hard work each day. There's a lot more to do. I am still exploring.&quot;
He also celebrated his 50th birthday on 23rd April. On hitting the golden jubilee of his life, Manoj said,
&quot;I do party every year but it used to be small. This time, it would be a little big. I will invite my colleagues from theatre and film industries.&quot;
He also added that all his struggling days have made him a stronger and a calmer person.

&quot;I am a completely different person now. Now I know how to channelise my anger and how to deal with odd and uncomfortable situations. Struggle teaches you a lot of things and I am happy that I witnessed a roller coaster ride. The journey has improved me as a person and made me more mature.&quot;
On the work front, Manoj is now looking forward to the release of his web show The Family Man.
