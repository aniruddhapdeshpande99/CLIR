Err. No. While many people hound you with 'when's the marriage' and 'When's the baby' questions, in real life, people actually have a different set of priorities.

Cut to, Anushka Sharma. Ever since she married Virat Kohli, there have been all sorts of rumors.

&ldquo;That (spreading rumors) is something people will do anyway. It’s completely unnecessary and silly as you ultimately can’t hide such a thing. You can hide a marriage but not pregnancy. I feel every female actor goes through it, so people marry you off even before you are hitched and make you a mother before you are pregnant. I don’t pay attention to it, and just laugh these things off since I find them hilarious. When I read about such stuff, I think, ‘where do such absurd things come from?’ Right now, I’m literally working round-the-clock&rdquo;
Anushka Sharma married Virat Kohli on December 11 in Tuscany last year and the couple has planned a special trip for their first anniversary.
