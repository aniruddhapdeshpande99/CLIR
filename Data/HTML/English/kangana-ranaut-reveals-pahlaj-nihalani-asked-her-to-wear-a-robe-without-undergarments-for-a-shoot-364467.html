Kangana said, &quot;The fact that people met, and promised to guide, help, but then I was put under house-arrest. And then Pahlaj Nihalani had offered me a film called I Love You Boss. They had a photo-shoot where they gave me a robe to wear, and no undergarments. So I just had a satin robe for a show-girl pose, from which I had to stick my leg out, coming out of darkness.&rdquo;
Twitter
She even recalled the time how her parents were super skeptical and scared with her decision of entering Bollywood, &quot;I was supposed to play a young girl lusting after her middle-aged boss. So it was a soft-porn sort of character. And I had this epiphany that I can't do this. I felt like this is exactly what my parents were talking about.&quot;
Twitter
Clearly the actress has seen a lot and come a long way. It takes courage to talk about the dark side of Bollywood, but Kangana is fearless, in fact, she is the one who started this nepotism debate and everyone is thankful to her.
