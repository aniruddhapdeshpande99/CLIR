Speaking about Shaheen's debut book, Alia said, &quot;When I read your very first book, a book that you have written with so much ease and honesty, while I struggle to write one letter to you. I feel awful. I feel terrible because despite living with you for 25 years, I have never really understood your silent moments of depression. I never recognized a snappy moment as something much bigger.&quot;

&quot;Every time you refused to go out for dinner, I would think she rather sit at home and watch TV, be alone, not that you couldn't bring yourself to get out of bed,&quot; she added.
Taking to Instagram, Alia writes a beautiful caption for a little sister. &quot;Dear Shaheen.. Somehow when I finished reading your book I couldn't tell you how I felt immediately.. Cause I felt too much.. And I don't think I could ever discuss it with you properly.. I've tried now! Link in bio.. #NeverBeenUnhappier&quot;
