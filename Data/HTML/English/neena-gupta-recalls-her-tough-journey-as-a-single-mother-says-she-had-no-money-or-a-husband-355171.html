The 59-year-old says she did a lot of work on the small screen.
&quot;I used to get small and useless roles in movies. Then I thought I should do just TV and today the fan following I have is because of working on television,&quot; added Neena, who is currently enjoying the success of her latest release &quot;Badhaai Ho&quot;.
The actress will next be seen in Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar, which also stars Arjun Kapoor and Parineeti Chopra.

&quot;There are not many roles. I always say that, 'After a certain age, what is a woman's role? Taking care of the family and home. After that there is no role'. When the society will change, I think we would have more roles on-screen.&quot;
Last year, Neena was in the spotlight after she took to social media to ask for &quot;good roles&quot;. She has now been frequently seen in films.

She describes her own journey as a mother &quot;very tough&quot;.
&quot;My journey was very tough. I had no money. Money is the most important thing, I have realised in this world. I didn't have a husband and relatives. So it was really tough, but the joy Masaba gave me... The joy of motherhood... She was a very good child she did not trouble me much. The joy she gave me was enough to go through anything,&quot; said Neena, who raised Masaba as a single mother.
