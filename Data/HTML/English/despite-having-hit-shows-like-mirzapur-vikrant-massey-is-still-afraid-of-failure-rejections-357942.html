Indiatimes had an exclusive conversation with the rising star Vikrant Massey where he spoke about his versatility, success, failure and more.
I Am Not A Trained Actor So I Act On The Basis Of Observation
To begin with, we spoke about his transition in both the web series and he said, &ldquo;It is very difficult for any artist if both the characters are poles apart. But I really don’t know how do I manage to get into the skin of characters, I can’t say myself how versatile I am but you guys say it and I am satisfied by it.

Doing such challenging roles do take a toll on you, but I feel it’s worth it when you receive appreciation. Broken and Mirzapur, both are very different and both my characters have gone through a lot of inner turmoil, and somewhere it affects you personally. But you are an actor and you have to justify what you take. I am not a trained actor, my acting is on observation. And it depends on psychology too, the moment you start feeling that character, you automatically become that and start performing in that way.
Success Is Temporary
Vikrant is aware that all the accolades he has been getting is temporary and doesn’t want to get the air of it, &ldquo;I am very much aware of it that all this is temporary, be it accolades or failure, nothing is permanent. Also, my upbringing has been in a way that we have been taught not to take everything seriously. Today I feel good when everyone is talking about me, but my entire focus is on my next project which I am shooting right now.&rdquo;

I Do Fear Failure
The Mirzapur actor admitted he fears failure and has a valid reason for it, &ldquo;Fear of failure is always there and it kind of works for me because it pushes me to do good work. I really enjoy the so-called praise that comes my way, but I also realise that this is temporary. I have just started and I want to work a lot, I honestly feel I don’t deserve all this right now unless there will be consistency in my performance. Maybe after a few years, I will take the appreciation wholeheartedly when I will be consistent with my performance.&rdquo;
Never Want People To Forget I Came From Television
Vikrant reveals TV actors are looked down upon and he wants to change that perspective, &ldquo;I never want people to forget that I have come from television; in fact, I make them remember every time that I have worked for 10 years on TV and I’m absolutely proud of it. Initially when I started my career in films, there was a time TV actors were looked down upon, it was said that TV actors don’t know how to act and that was my only motivation. If there would be no TV, I wouldn’t be here. There are lots of TV actors who are ashamed to call themselves as a TV actor. But I am very proud of it, also if you see, today a lot of good actors and directors have come from TV, I am not talking about stars, I am talking about actors, who have done television, right from Manoj Bajpayee, Irrfan Khan to Pankaj Kapur, they all have done theatre and television, I just feel that you shouldn’t limit artist to one medium.&rdquo;

Today We Just Cannot Take Audiences For Granted
Vikrant talks about the current change in entertainment which is giving all the actors an opportunity to up their game, &ldquo;Change is inevitable and we all know, if anything is stagnant it will cause disease, so we have to flow like water and artists should be like flowing water.
Talking about today’s scenario in entertainment, the best thing is there is no border, today we all can watch all kinds of shows and cinema on the internet. Also, we actors have got an amazing platform where we can showcase more and more of our talent. A show like Mirzapur is seen in 202 countries which is 70 percent of population of the world, we had never thought of this time 5 years ago.
Our exposure has increased, and most important, today people want to invest their money and time on substantial things, eat good or see good. And also this is our opportunity to up our game, better ourselves, this is an ongoing process, today we are here, tomorrow there will be better actors. People want to see good and relatable content; we just cannot take our audiences taken for granted. In the past 5 years, we have seen so many examples that either there is a good film or a bad film. I am fortunate to be a part of this time.

Rejection Is A Part Of Life
Vikrant admits he gets rejected even today and will continue to be better at his job, &ldquo;I am not someone who will give up. I have been a sportsman all my life and will be, I have played sports all my life, so the idea is, never give up. I face rejection even today. There are lots of directors I want to work with, and maybe even they want to work with me but maybe they can’t, and that is also a rejection.
But I have learned to take rejection in my stride, Like a normal middle-class man I too have a passion of doing better and living better and then will go on, it will never end. I face rejection even today, but I try to take it in my stride and improve myself. It’s a cycle and I respect that. You do feel bad when you are rejected, when you are told, you can’t do this, but that doesn’t mean I stop, my job is to go on and I will do that. Rejection is a part of life, we don’t live in a utopian life.&quot;
