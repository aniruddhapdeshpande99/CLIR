NCP chief Sharad Pawar Wednesday demanded Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' resignation following the incident. &quot;He should step down immediately&quot;, Pawar tweeted adding &quot;Those who feel shame of conscience if not shame of public opinion would have resigned. But the people who are in power today are not going to do so.&quot;

I totally condemn Naxal attack in Gadchiroli, killing 16. Dastardly, inhuman & reflects the utterly degenerate mindset of the so-called ‘revolutionaries’. Ultra left & anarchist violence weakens democracy, hurts the poor. The state must crack down on perpetrators & ensure justice — Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) May 1, 2019
My tributes to the martyrs & jawans who lost their lives in terrible #NaxalAttack on our security personnel in #Gadchiroli, #Maharashtra. I pray for the families of jawans and wish the injured a speedy recovery — Sunny Deol (@iamsunnydeol) May 1, 2019
Terrible news coming in from Maharashtra. This HAS to stop! In solidarity with the families of those that lost their loved ones. Prayers, love, strength. These words have started to seem hollow for they are said too often. Salute to our commandoes. #Gadchiroli — Mithali Raj (@M_Raj03) May 1, 2019
Strongly condemn the despicable attack on our security personnel in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra. I salute all the brave personnel. Their sacrifices will never be forgotten. My thoughts & solidarity are with the bereaved families. The perpetrators of such violence will not be spared. — Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 1, 2019
This is a ghastly attack - burning a dozen vehicles to create the diversion to boobytrap security forces. Such terror tactics must be condemned by every Indian.
Terrorism has no ideology or flag - red, green, saffron or black. Nothing justifies any kind of terrorism!#IndiaFirst https://t.co/OZUpcJHGXe — Rakesh Sharma (@rakeshfilm) May 1, 2019
The dastardly attack on our security personnel in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra is shameful & sad. I hope the urban naxals, Congress, tukde tukde gang , Lutyens media will not ask for proofs of this massacre of our soldiers. Heartfelt Condolences to the bereaved families. ओम् शांति ! — Ashoke Pandit (@ashokepandit) May 1, 2019
OMG. This is terrible. This was coming. I have been saying it for long. Since the new government in Chhattisgarh Naxal movement has rejuvinated. The entire #UrbanNaxals ecosystem has been working to create unrest and chaos.
My prayers with the victims families. https://t.co/QcO5zFUf9B — Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri (@vivekagnihotri) May 1, 2019
Before the blast, Naxals had torched 25 vehicles belonging to a road construction contractor.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
