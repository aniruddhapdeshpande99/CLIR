&quot;I love competition and you can see that in the film. Competition is so much fun. It is very motivating having new people. The industry does need new talent all the time,&quot; Ananya told reporters Friday at the trailer launch of Student of the Year 2.
The film, directed by Punit Malhotra, also features Tiger Shroff and another newcomer, Tara Sutaria. It follows the lives of students of St. Teresa College as they all vie for the Student of the Year trophy. Tara Sutaria said,

&quot;I don't think competition is going to be unhealthy. It is going to be healthy. I am excited. I have seen couple of films and you will see our film.&quot;
Both Ananya and Tara are excited to be making their debut with 'Student of the Year 2'. &quot;I can't imagine I'm here. This day feels like a dream. This is very surreal. I am grateful to Karan Johar and Punit Malhotra. I am just too excited,&quot; Ananya said.
The film, produced by Karan Johar through his banner Dharma Productions, is a sequel to 2012's 'Student of the Year', which had marked the acting debuts of Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra.
