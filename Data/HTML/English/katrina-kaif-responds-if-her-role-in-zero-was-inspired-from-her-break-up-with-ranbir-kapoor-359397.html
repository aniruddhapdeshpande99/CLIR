Katrina plays the role of a heartbroken actress who gets addicted to alcohol. A lot of people spoke about the fact that her role of Babita has drawn inspiration from her real breakup with actor Ranbir Kapoor.
Talking to Film companion, the actress opened up and said,
Instagram
&quot;I knew that people are gonna try and connect the dots but I also knew that when they see the film they can't do that because the pitch of that character is so different. The pitch of that character is not me...That's not me. That's not my behavior.&quot;

&quot;To me the way she's (Babita) talking (in the film), to me it is outlandish as a person that I am. In my mind, I'm exactly the opposite of her. I'm very subtle. Everything for me is underplayed.&quot;
Reports claim that Zero opened quite well at the box office (Rs 20 crore), but on the second day (Rs 16 crore) itself, the collections started to dip.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
