Shah Rukh Khan Sheds Light On Importance Of Training In Acting, Wants Suhana To Learn The Craft Before Debut

For long, acting in films was considered the least skilled of all the performing arts. Didn’t we all think that anyone can be picked from the streets and taught acting? All you need is a face and a great physique, right?
But times are changing. Actors who earlier played sidekicks – like Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Vicky Kaushal – are now playing main leads and on the other hand, several films of the big stars including Salman Khan’s Race 3 have failed miserably at the box office.

&ldquo;In India, I think we don't learn acting, we just assume that we are talented. Like if you drive very first, it first mean you are going to become a Formula 1 driver. You'll have to finally learn it. So I want her to have a formal training in acting. The experience matters a lot,&rdquo; he said.

He, furthermore, said that he wants her to learn the craft. He revealed she visited him on the sets of his upcoming film Zero to observe how things work.
&ldquo;She came on sets because learning acting has a lot to do with spending time on the sets and learning production. She did the same in London and while she was here.She said she still has two weeks to go back to London and we were shooting a song for 'Zero' in the coming two weeks. So she came here to have that experience.

Shah Rukh Khan said that he wanted Suhana to learn the nuances from Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif.
&ldquo;I wanted her to see Anushka and Katrina perform live as both are such different kind of actors. Katrina has her own charm and Anushka has her own way of enacting things. So I wanted her to spend time (on sets). So what they did is they put her onto me as an assistant director.
&quot;But I think ground experience is good for actors or any kind of job, only as an internship. But you have to finish your education first. If you have the opportunity to study, it formalises and makes your craft better. So, I want her to study first for some time.&quot;
