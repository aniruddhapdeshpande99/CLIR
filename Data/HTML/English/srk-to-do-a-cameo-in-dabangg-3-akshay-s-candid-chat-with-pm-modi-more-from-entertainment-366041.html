Accept it or not, you must have felt a little uncomfortable as that scene played on your TV screens, right? Well, a lot of fans complained to Maisie Williams online, and she has finally responded.
But it was his dedication that helped him make a mark in his career. He rose to fame with his role of a gangster in Satya and later featured in hit films like Shool, Zubeidaa and Pinjar. His filmography is diverse and as an actor, he has never stopped taking risks.
Speaking to a leading portal, a source close to the project revealed, &ldquo;Dabangg 3 has a few flashback portions which will trace Salman's journey before he became the Robinhood of the area. There's a character. It's of a man who helps Salman during an important scene. The team was thinking of a few names when Salman decided to call his good friend Shah Rukh to shoot for it. Salman and SRK did a FaceTime call a few weeks back, which is when Salman asked him if he can make an appearance in D3. SRK happily said yes to it.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
