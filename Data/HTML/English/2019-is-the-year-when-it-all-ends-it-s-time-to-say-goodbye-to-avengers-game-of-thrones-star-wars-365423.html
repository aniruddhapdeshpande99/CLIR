So, 2019 is a big year on many fronts and there are a lot of things to look forward to. The current mood of the India revolves around Lok Sabha elections that will decide who will rule the largest democracy for next five years. But it’s not only the real-life that we are talking about. There is a lot going on in the world of films and Television as well.
The finale season of Game Of Thrones, the season 8 in which the fans after years of wait will finally get to know as to who will win the game of ice and fire and end up sitting on the Iron Throne after having defeated the army of dead (White Walkers). It’s just a day away. Game Of Thrones season 8 will premiere tomorrow morning for Indian fans.
And then on April 26, Avengers: Endgame will hit the screens finally. After 11 years and 21 movies, the film will finally conclude another phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Are you ready to witness the retirement of your favourite superheroes?
And that’s not all, my friends. In the same month when the two of the biggest franchises – Game Of Thrones and Avengers – will begin their conclusions, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker’s trailer has also been released. The final entry in the Star Wars trilogy will hit the screens on Dec 20.
