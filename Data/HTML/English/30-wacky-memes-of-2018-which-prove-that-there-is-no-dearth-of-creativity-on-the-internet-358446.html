30 Wacky Memes Of 2018 Which Prove That There Is No Dearth Of Creativity On The Internet
In the era of digital explosion, most of us spend a major chunk of our day on the internet. Come on, if the minute you open your eyes in the morning and don‚Äôt reach out for your phone to surf the internet, then you my friend, are a misfit in this world! Moving on, I think it‚Äôs also necessary that we take a minute to praise the creativity that we witness almost everyday on the internet.
God bless those strangers who sit in front of their screens and come out with some rib-tickling content in the form of tweets, memes and jokes. If only these memes paid off, those meme-makers would be millionaires by now. The best part is that there is hardly anything that escapes their scrutiny. Now that the year has come to an end, it‚Äôs time we retrospect and curate the best memes that 2018 gave us. Scroll!

#2 Don't call yourself a Marvel fan if you weren't offended by Avengers: Infinity War. Even The Hulk was pissed off!
