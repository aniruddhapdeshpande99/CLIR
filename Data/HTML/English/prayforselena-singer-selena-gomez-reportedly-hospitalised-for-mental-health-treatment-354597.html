The reason for admission is cited to be an emotional breakdown.
According to a source close to TMZ, the 26-year-old singer was at Studio City during the last week of September when the first emergency hit her. Selena got emotional after a drip in her white blood cell count, which happened due to the kidney transplant which she underwent. It was a family member who took Selena to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
TMZ also reports that, weeks later the singer had to be re-admitted as her low blood cell count persisted. She is currently being treated at East Coast psychiatric facility.
