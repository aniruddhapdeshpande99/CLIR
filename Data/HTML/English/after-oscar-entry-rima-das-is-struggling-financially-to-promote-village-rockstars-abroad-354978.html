Perhaps, it is to see his/her movie going to the Oscars. Independent filmmaker Rima Das was high on happiness when her Assamese film Village Rockstars became India’s official entry to the Academy Awards 2019 under Best Foreign language category. But not a lot of people know that she is struggling to keep her Oscar dream alive now.
Oscar lobbying is just one month away, and director Rima Das is lacking the financial support to promote Village Rockstars. The film was reportedly made on a budget of Rs 30 lakhs. And now, in order to make the movie more visible in Hollywood, Rima Das needs funds.
To support India’s official entry to Oscars 2019, Assam government has promised her Rs. 1 crore. According to TOI, she has been assured that the tax will be waived. However, in case, the tax isn’t waived, she will only get Rs 68 lakhs.

&ldquo;My friend Adil [Hussain, whose film What Will People Say is the Norwegian entry] told me I need at least Rs 5 crore. How will I promote my film without any money,&rdquo; Rima Das told Mid-Day.
Rim Das wants government to extend support to her and take her movie forward.
