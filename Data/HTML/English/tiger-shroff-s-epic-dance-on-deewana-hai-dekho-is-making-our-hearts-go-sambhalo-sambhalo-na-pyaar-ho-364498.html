Does this song play in your head too, when you spot a hot guy? And do you also wait for the back dancers to assemble behind you soon while your best friend besides you sings &ldquo;Jhoom chiki chiki jhoom… Tum bolo hai woh kaun jo…&rdquo;? This was simply an epic song from a cult film called Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham!

Even after years, when you watch it, you can’t help but praise how effortlessly Hrithik Roshan danced to it. I mean, who can dance better than him, right? We thought so too, until we saw Tiger Shroff shaking a leg on the song, and boy, we are left awestruck.

Just imagine how it would be to see Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff dancing together in a movie? Well, that is going to be a reality soon. Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff are collaborating for a yet-to-be-titled Yash Raj banner movie, and he is on cloud nine.
&ldquo;It was like a dream come true moment for me. After every shot, when I see him on the monitor, I feel like I am dreaming because it has been my childhood fantasy working with him. When we do a high speed shot or an action scene then it feels amazing,&rdquo; he had earlier said.
We want to see a dance face-off between Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff. Do you want that too? Meanwhile, watch Deewana Hai Dekho below and get nostalgic!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
