&ldquo;Globally, 1 in 7 people are with disabilities. This makes them the world's largest minority. Their voices must be heard and hence I stand by the Rev-Up campaign. It's time to be inclusive and step-up, and help persons with disabilities to register, enable and vote,&rdquo; Esha Deol said in a statement.
Reeta Gupta of The Network who guided Coena to develop the campaign, said it brings together disability rights organisations in the country and all corporates who support disability rights.
Arman Ali of NCPEDP said that on a more holistic note, the campaign is also about revving up participation of persons with disabilities in the electoral process as candidates and representatives.
