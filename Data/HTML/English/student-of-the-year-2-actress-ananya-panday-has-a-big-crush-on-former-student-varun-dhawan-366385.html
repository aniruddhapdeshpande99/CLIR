Student Of The Year 2 Actress Ananya Panday Has A Big Crush On Former 'Student' Varun Dhawan
Rhe nepotism trend continues and no, we don't say so. On Koffee With Karan, Chunky Panday's daughter Ananya Panday admitted she got an easy debut and is forever grateful to Dharma for the big break.
Yes, Ananya Panday is all set to make a mega debut with Student Of The Year 2 opposite Tiger Shroff and Tara Sutaria. While many thought, the two actresses will crush on Tiger but looks like their choices are very clear. Since Tiger is so vocal (his Sundays at Bastian say it all) about his relationship with Disha Patani, Ananya has taken a liking to one of the former students.
Ananya, who featured on the cover of a leading magazine spoke about her favourites in Bollywood, &quot;Alia Bhatt and Kareena Kapoor Khan. I am obsessed with both of them. Even Varun Dhawan! His energy...and he is so cute. He knows I am in love with him and it's a bit awkward.&quot;

That's not all, during a recent press interaction, Ananya still went on about her Varun Dhawan.
Talking about her crazy obsession for the Badlapur actor, she stated, &quot;I am the biggest Varun Dhawan fan ever. His picture used to be my wallpaper. The one wherein he was shirtless with a guitar in his hand. As of now, Punit Malhotra's picture is my wallpaper as SOTY 2 is coming out.&quot;
On Varun Dhawan's birthday too, Ananya declared him as the student of the decade who she will forever crush on.
Clearly, Ananya Panday's feeling for Varun Dhawan is practically all of us. Ananya's debut film Student Of The Year 2 is slated to release on 10th May, 2019 and is directed by Punit Malhotra.
