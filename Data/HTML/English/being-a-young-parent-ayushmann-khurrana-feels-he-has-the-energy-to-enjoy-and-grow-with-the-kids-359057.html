On how it was for him to be a hands-on parent, Ayushmann said, &quot;Today, I had to wear glasses because I got up early in the morning for a shoot. It was also her (his daughter Varushkaâ€™s) sports day and I was all ready and geared up to win that 100-meter race with fellow parents as I was one of the youngest out there.
&quot;I was really excited, but sadly that didn't happen. Even though I've under-slept today, it is alright. It is good to be a young father, a young parent. You have that energy and you are growing up with them.&quot;

Ayushmann and Tahira Kashyap have a daughter Varushka and a son Virajveer. He feels his son is more talented than him when it comes to playing the piano.
&quot;Being a young parent, I can play cricket, football and chess with my son. In fact, he plays the piano better than I do. We got the piano installed because of my film AndhaDhun. He started learning recently and already has a concert coming up&quot; said Ayushmann, who will next be seen in Bala as a man dealing with premature balding.
