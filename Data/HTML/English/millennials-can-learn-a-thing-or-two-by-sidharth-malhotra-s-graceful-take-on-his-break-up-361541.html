You must be living under a rock if you're unaware of the fact that SOTY actors Alia Bhatt and Sidharth Malhotra were dating at one point of time. All was well between the two actors but as they say, somethings don't work out and they decided to part ways.

In a heart to heart chat with Karan Johar, who is also Sid's mentor, he went on reveal how his and Alia's equation changed but they still share a very civil equation. He said,
Dharma Productions
&quot;We haven't met after it. Our relationship is civil. I don't think it's bitter. It's been a while. I have known her for much longer even before we dated. I gave my first ever shot with her in SOTY, I was crazy, and there is so much history&quot;
When KJo further asked Sid if it's easy for him to let go off the equation he shared with Alia and can make an honest attempt in moving on professionally, he said,
Dharma Productions
&quot;There is a reason why two people decide not to be together. There were lots of ups and downs. When you take yourself from a situation, you look at all the happy and good memories.&quot;
Sid's graceful take on his breakup is definitely a lesson for all the millennials. No matter who leaves or who stays, life always goes on and for Sid and Alia, their relationship might have ended but they are definitely open to professional collaborations.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
