The performances of @SiddhantChturvD and @kalkikanmani deserve a very special mention. Siddhant is incredibly believable and looks like he totally belongs to the world and loved Kalki’s portrayal of Sky... what a lovely character ! ❤️❤️❤️ #GullyBoy — Soni Razdan (@Soni_Razdan) February 14, 2019
And finally the last word must go to Zoya Akhtar who has created a film that will smash all kinds of ceilings ... that so effortlessly draws us into another world and yet speaks about everyone’s worlds at the same time... and made a film that belongs to us all.
