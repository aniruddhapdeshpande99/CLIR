&ldquo;Kalaripayattu is a discipline that has encouraged people to pick up on strength, sensibility and personality traits of various fantastic animals. It was amazing for me to extend my knowledge of Kalaripayattu by practicing animal flow. Most of the conventional exercises in the gym isolate only two muscles at a time. However, training like an animal functionally overcomes this one way to optimize strength, flexibility, mind-body control,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by theindianwire.com.
&ldquo;Humans are emotional beasts and hence face trouble in being in the moment. That is why we are not natural fighters like the leopard or the tiger who do not get paralyzed by fear. These animals do not get paralyzed by guilt situation. This awareness, apart from additional strength from animal flow helped me be at ease with the animals I shot with for ‘Junglee’. I was awed by the depth of this stream of martial arts and wanted to bring on the big screen with ‘Junglee’,&rdquo; he added.
The trailer is slated to release on March 6.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
