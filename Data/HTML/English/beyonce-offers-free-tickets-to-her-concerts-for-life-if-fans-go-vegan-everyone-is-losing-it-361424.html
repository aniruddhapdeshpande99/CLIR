Beyonce hasn’t really done a concert in India for reasons unknown. However, last year, she came to India for private concert for Ambanis. The diva performed all her popular songs but fans went into a tizzy catching glimpses of the snippets being shared on social media.
Looks like, in order to attend her concerts, you will have to fly abroad. But what if we tell you that she is offering free tickets to all her concerts for a lifetime? No, we are not kidding.

This is actually a part of The Greenprint Project, which Beyonce and Jay Z are promoting. The Greenprint Project is dedicated to showing us all how eating just one plant-based meal a day can help the environment.
&ldquo;Our Greenprint is the positive impact we can have on the world by eating plant-based meals,&rdquo; reads its website.
&ldquo;What is your Greenprint? Click the link in my bio for a chance to win tickets to any JAY and/or my shows for life,&rdquo; wrote Beyonce in an Instagram post and fans are going bonkers since then.
