â€˜OMG Yesâ€™! Anushka Sharma And Her Doppelganger Julia Michaelsâ€™ Reaction On Seeing Each Otherâ€™s Picture Is Priceless
How would you react on seeing someone who looks uncannily similar to you? I would be fascinated but at the same time creeped out too.
But because itâ€™s a big damn world, most of us might never come across our own doppelgangers. However, in case of a celebrity, when your face is plastered almost everywhere including social media, it doesnâ€™t take much effort to spot a look-alike.
Thatâ€™s what happened recently. After Salman Khanâ€™s doppelganger was spotted in Karachi, Pakistan, Anushka Sharmaâ€™s look-alike was found in America. And not just a random person, but Anushka Sharma looks quite similar to American singer Julia Michaels.

Anushka Sharma was quick to notice this. In her response, she wrote, &ldquo;OMG YES!! I've been looking for you and the remaining 5 of our dopplegangers all my life.&quot;
