She embarked her journey into the world of films with Vicky Donor which went on to become one of the biggest hits of that year. After a promising debut came a rocky road with films that couldn't work but that in no way deter her spirit or enthusiasm to prove herself as a good performer.
In a heart to heart chat with Indiatimes, Yami Gautam takes us through her journey from her debut film Vicky Donor to the bumps in the road that didn't detour her from her aim in life to how and why Uri became one of the most promising and satisfying projects for her. Read on!
Q: Uri has become 2019's first big hit and the dialogues and scenes from the film have become a cult. With all this love and validation, how does it make you feel as an actor?
Yami: I was extremely confident about the script and the subject. It is also very important for the actors to have faith in the director and the team. Aditya (Director, Uri) said something in just one line (After reading the script): he said I want to make a film which not just the audiences love but a film that even the Indian army is proud of. For me, that intention and honesty were extremely important. I knew that it was going to be a very good film. The technical team and all the actors, all of us had an instinct and the vibe that this one is going to be a good film with which even the audiences will be able to connect with. What I didn't see coming was it go on to become a wave, a rage in the country. It’s hard to describe but the kind of reaction we are getting after the film and all of this is overwhelming. The way the people are clapping and the dialogue- for any actor, this validation is extremely heartwarming. Even on the army day when we went and meet the army and the president, we only earned praises for the project. So, all this was very surreal. The hard work of the whole team got its due.
Q: In a first, we saw your mellow version on the screen as Pallavi in Uri who had such a huge responsibility of ensuring that the mission becomes a success. What special preps did you do for the role?
RSVP Films
Yami: I didn’t have too many onscreen references for the character to lean on. When I started preparing for the role during our workshop, I asked Aditya how to go about it and he again said something really compelling that 'don’t try to project the character, instead, try to internalize it'. Because I had not met any intelligence officer before but Aditya had and based on all the anecdotes that he shared, I drew my references for the character. I understood that the officers are extremely unpretentious and you’ll never even get to know that they are officers. That’s how I approached my character.
Q: Instead of donning a wig or prosthetics, you actually took the plunge of chopping off your hair. Considering how it is a big deal for actresses, what made you confident about the move?
Yami: When we were designing the character, we discussed and obviously, we thought that a more practical approach towards it is important. We consciously took the decision of cutting down on the time of hair-make up and the whole vanity van time. My father was literally very upset when I told him that I was going to chop off my hair for the role. But later when he watched the film, he understood why I did that and how the character was so natural. We didn’t want to use the wig because the look would have again looked very artificial. We wanted the role to be as authentic and natural as possible. Since childhood, I was this Rapunzel in my head but I am really glad that I took this step to make Pallavi more real. I didn’t even think twice before getting it done. It had meaning and reason behind it and I am glad we did that.
4. A lot of actors are very conscious of the screentime they get in a film. We have seen you pick a lot of projects where even though your contribution was validated but they were mostly cameos and special appearances. Any specific strategy that goes behind picking up the films?
Yami: For me, as an actor, it will be a little awkward to justify my screentime or my presence in the film so I wouldn’t want to break it down. I take it as a privilege as an actor that I got the opportunity to pull off some of the most compelling characters. For example, Vicky Donor was different, Kaabil was different. In Uri, Pallavi plays a very crucial role in the entire operation so I am glad that the director saw me as a perfect fit for the role and he was shackled with the stereotypical notion of what roles I played or for how long I was on the screen for the film. For me, being diverse and being part of such strong stories and films is really important. I foresee how substantial is my role in the film and how I am going to add value to a certain project. I am hungry for good work and I want to prove myself as an actor first. In today’s time, the audiences want to see stories and characters that are captivating. I am proud of all my films and not just because they went on to become hits but because of the characters, I got to play. From Shoojit Sircar to Sriram Raghavan to Rakesh Roshan- the experiences have been extremely enriching.
5. Being an actor or a public figure makes you very vulnerable to online trolling and harsh criticism. How do you deal with it?
Yami: Luckily, I am one of the most non-controversial stars and I am very happy with this tag and I intend to carry this forward. And even if there is criticism or negativity, you need to take it with a pinch of salt. You need to understand that today there are mediums for people to reach out to you and express themselves. And, sometimes, there actually is a good observation that maybe I could have failed to see. And sometimes, you need to just ignore and move on. Considering we are public figures and popular and vulnerable, we can’t let these opinions define or break us.
6. You have earlier expressed your opinion on how the film industry could be an emotionally exhausting place? Amidst this madness of fame, popularity and pressure, how you strike an optimum work-life balance and maintain sanity?
Yami: Yes, absolutely. We as actors need to understand that there is a life beyond work and screen. For me, I understand that as much as I want to enjoy my work, I want to also explore my life and live it to the fullest. You need to keep evolving as a person and as an actor but your soul should always remain the same. I worship my work but it is not my entire life. For me to maintain sanity and positivity- I make efforts. I divide and segregate the pressures related to my work and my personal life. It’s also important to stay in touch with people who really know you and love you for who you are. Be it your family or friends, you need to choose you, people, as they are the ones who keep you grounded. When I meet my set of people and school friends, they treat me as the same person. They help you retain your sanity and who you are as a person. I believe that all the hard work you do and what you achieve- having gratitude is very important. We often tend to lean towards but gratitude is very important. You need to be thankful for what you have without compromising on your ambition as an actor. If you don’t enjoy what you do and seize the day in a city like Bombay, you need to be thankful and maintain a work-life balance.
7. There has been a lot of conversations around pay disparity in the film industry and how female actors still have a long way to go. Your take?
Instagram
Yami: I think the whole idea is very subject as it mainly depends on the kind of film you do and the kind of budget it has. I am very glad that at least the dialog and conversation has started. And I am very hopeful that a fair remuneration scheme will eventually happen. It depends on a lot of factors as maybe just after two films, the fee can shoot up.
8. In every actor's career, there is a lull phase where nothing exciting comes up. As an actor/performer, how do you cope up with it and try to stay relevant?
Agencies
Yami: For me, right after Vicky Donor, there was this weird phase. While Vicky Donor was a huge success, my second and the third film didn’t do well at all. You just don ‘t know a way out and especially with media bombarding you with questions. You don’t feel low and dejected but you need to shake yourself up and remind yourself of the purpose of being here. You need to remind yourself of the struggles you have had to reach here on your own. You need to constantly pep up yourself and understand that when you are making it here on your own and you have no connections in the industry and if you are someone who is not very socializing, you need to understand that consistency is the key. If a film doesn't do well, you need to choose the next project more carefully. It’s important to just keep moving on. You need to believe strongly in the purpose of existence of being in the industry and why you leave your hometown. And you need to accept the fact that while you accept the success of a film, you also need to gracefully embrace your failures in life. Today, I know that the kind of response of Uri has got- it’s overwhelming but you can’t keep on carrying the success or failure of your project to your next project. You just need to keep moving on.
9. With all the hoopla around nepotism and favoritism in Bollywood, how does it make you feel as an 'outsider' or someone who has no solid connections in the industry? Is it a challenge?
Yami: It is heartbreaking and not easy. But I honestly believe that everyone has their own challenges and expectations you need to live up to. But then it’s all about your hard work and destiny because no matter whose son or daughter you’re, it’s all about what and how you do. For me, if my film fails, I might not have an option of proving myself again but someone from the industry might have an option of exploiting a second chance by taking up another project. Honestly, I enjoy the whole process because the whole outsider perspective, I wouldn’t trade for anything. It’s just about enjoying it all and utilizing your hardship. I just believe in the fact that if somethings don’t work out, I always see the silver siling while moving on.
10. A lot of actors including Abhay Deol and Sonam Kapoor have taken a strict stand against fairness cream endorsements. Since you have been associated with a brand, does this negativity and trolling affect you or your choice of endorsements in any way?
Agencies
I would never say I am ‘proudly’ endorsing fairness products or I wouldn’t even use an adjective. I would just say I am doing my work. For me, technically, I was already roped in for a brand endorsement long before Vicky Donor happened. I was roped in as a model and way back then, I started working and I was an independent girl and I took it as work. And I have come here step by step. I had a meeting with the brand that I endorse and we collaborated on the fact that the essence of it should be progressive. The ads I do are not like what they used to be years ago. I was very particular that the message that goes out shouldn’t be that if you are not fair- it’s something to be unhappy about or to feel uncool about. This is how I took it as. Now that I endorse a fairness product, I know what message I am executing. And everyone talks about being independent and working and these products have always been here and the concepts have changed.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
