Speaking at the event, she said, &quot;From the Motown records I wore out on the Southside to the 'Who Run the World' songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story.&quot;
She further added, &quot;Music helps us share ourselves, our dignity and sorrows, our hopes, our joys. Music shows us that all of it matters.&quot;
Gaga too spoke on the power of music, saying, &ldquo;They said I was weird, but music led me to all of you and to my little monsters, who I love so much,&rdquo; while Lopez quipped in, &ldquo;Back in the Bronx, music gave me a reason to dance.&quot;

Pinkett Smith added, &quot;Every voice we hear deserves to be honoured and respected.&quot;
Host Keys ended the segment by saying, &quot;Who run the world?&quot; which was met with applause from the audience and the start of the show.
During the Grammy awards, Michelle Obama also posted about female friendship on Twitter, writing, &ldquo;A big part of friendship is showing up for your girls—that’s why I was thrilled to be there for the one and only @aliciakeys at the #GRAMMYs. She is one of the most genuine and thoughtful people I know—there’s no one better to help us all celebrate the unifying power of music!&rdquo;

Notably, the move to include a female host along with four women who joined her onstage during the monologues comes a year after Recording Academy president Neil Portnow was heavily criticised over his comments that female musicians should &quot;step up&quot; to improve gender representation at the Grammys.
American singer Ariana Grande, who skipped the 2019 Grammy, won her first-ever award for best pop vocal album for ‘Sweetener’.
The announcement was made in the pre-telecast ceremony where a majority of the awards are given. Grande beat a tough lot of competition including Camila Cabello, Kelly Clarkson, Shawn Mendes, Pink and Taylor Swift, confirmed The Hollywood Reporter.

Grande took to Twitter on Sunday (local time) to thank the Recording Academy for the award.
&quot;I know I’m not there tonight (trust, I tried and still truly wished it had worked out tbh) and I know I said I try not to put too much weight into these things. This is wild and beautiful. Thank you so much,&rdquo; she wrote.
Drake won a Grammy in best rap song category for ‘God’s Plan’. However, his speech was cut short by the producers of the show.

There was already tension between the rapper and the Recording Academy. Drake and fellow top nominees Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino all refused to perform at the 2019 Grammy Awards, which made the show’s producer Ken Ehrlich admit that the Grammys &ldquo;continue to have a problem in the hip-hop world,&quot; reported The Hollywood Reporter.
However, it was Lady Gaga, who stole the show. Lady Gaga took home three Grammy this year. Gaga won best pop solo performance for ‘Joanne (Where Do You Think You're Goin'?)’, best song written for visual media for ‘Shallow’ and best pop duo/group performance for ‘Shallow’ (shared with Bradley Cooper), revealed The Hollywood Reporter.

This news comes just hours after the singer won a BAFTA Award for original music at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards in London. This win made her the person to win a BAFTA and a Grammy in the same day, reported Variety.
