Earlier Shraddha Kapoor and Kirti Sanon were being considered for the role, however, looks like Sara Khan just might be the chosen one. As per a source in leading daily,
&quot;With Shraddha on board, it would be a reunion of the ABCD 2 trio, along with Varun and Remo. They have an equation and that would help in their collaborating on another dance flick. The other strong contender for the role is Sara Ali Khan. She has proved her acting chops in Kedarnath and has been appreciated in Simmba too. Signing her would also mean a fresh new onscreen pair. And Varun and Sara together are bound to generate tremendous buzz for this dance movie. So yes, the makers are definitely looking at the advantage of casting Sara for the film.&quot;
