The second season of the show is garnering a lot of love but there is something very prominent that's missing.
Twitter
In all the social media posts, fans are flooding the comments section, urging Kapil Sharma to bring back Sunil Grover for the show.
On the other hand, Sunil Grover's show Kanpur Wale Khuranas recently went off the air. While rumors claimed that it was due to low TRP's, Grover had a legit reason. Talking to PInkvilla, he had said,
&quot;It is because of me. I had signed the show for 8 weeks ONLY because my dates were locked for Bharat (Salman Khan‚Äôs film), the movie. I had made this clear even during the press conference and interviews that I could only accommodate this much time. I am kickstarting the last leg of the shoot for Bharat from today, and I just want to thank the team who made this show happen including the channel and the guests who accommodated dates because of my schedule.&quot;

He took to Twitter to write that he is all set to start shooting for Salman Khan's Bollywood movie Bharat and has begun his 40-day schedule.

Well, if an IBT report is to be believed, Sunil Grover might just join back Kapil Show's after wrapping Bharat.
Just to jog your memory a little, Kapil Sharma had spoken about Sunil Grover and his show. He had said,
Sony TV
&quot;Leave the old things. He (Sunil Grover) is my friend but he has some film commitments. He is working in Salman Khan's Bharat, besides Patakha is also ready. I had met him and had discussed the concept of the show with him. He told me that he has some commitments but we will have to start the show near Diwali. As soon as he (Sunil) gets free from his commitments he will join the show as it will go long. The film commitments last between 30 to 40 days. He is most welcome.&quot;
While there is no confirmation on the same, fans all over India are praying for this reunion to happen real soon.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
