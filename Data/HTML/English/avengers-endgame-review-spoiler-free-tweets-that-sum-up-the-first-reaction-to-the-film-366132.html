When to take pee breaks when you attend &ldquo;Avengers: Endgame&rdquo;:

#AvengerEndgame is an immensely satisfying payoff, not just to Infinity War but to all the films that came before. This is why the MCU. (And I say this as someone who was not especially enamored of Infinity War, FWIW.) ‚ô•Ô∏èüíôüíú ‚Äî Angie J. Han (@ajhan) April 23, 2019

#AvengersEndgame just ended. No spoiler, but some first thoughts.
Epic is the word. Epic multiplied by a decade of emotion, excitement and investment. This is the payoff.
It left me with a full heart, but one I had has some scars on it. Those are the strongest kind, after all. pic.twitter.com/Ay2rXISBOB ‚Äî Anthony Breznican (@Breznican) April 23, 2019

This can't be understated: #AvengersEndgame is everything you want it to be and more. I am absolutely floored. A perfect reflection on the last 11 years that pays off everything in the best way possible. Without question my new favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe film. Stunned. pic.twitter.com/5LvFw9UEBQ ‚Äî Eric Eisenberg (@eeisenberg) April 23, 2019
