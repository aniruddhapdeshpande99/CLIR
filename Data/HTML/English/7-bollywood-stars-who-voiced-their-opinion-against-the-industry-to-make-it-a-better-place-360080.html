Many people dream and aspire to make a mark in one of those big banner films. Millions reach Mumbai to fulfil their dreams, hoping for a big break. Unfortunately only a few succeed and many return empty handed.
The industry is glamorous and people who are a part of it are truly blessed. But there are a few who don't follow the herd or give in to industry pressure.
Here's taking a look at seven such celebrities who spoke against the film industry.
1. Katrina compares Bollywood to a dysfunctional family
Speaking to a leading daily, Katrina Kaif claimed that the film industry is a dysfunctional family and that every member here has different quirks.

Katrina who usually maintains silence over issues says there are times that you don’t like certain members of your family but it does not change the fact that they are close.
She further added that after working in Bollywood for so many years, she has best of relationship with some and with others she harbours angst but that still is a relationship because ultimately it’s all in the same family.
2. John Abraham calls Bollywood actors clowns in a circus
John Abraham has been one of the few actors who is not seen in the A-lister circuit. He is seen in films and then goes back into his personal space. Whether it's airport looks or night parties, John is hardly seen anywhere. He likes to keep his personal life private and it's admirable how he's succeeding in this. Speaking about trolls to a leading daily, John said,
&quot;There is but aren't celebrities also asking for it, wearing funny clothes outside airports and doing funny things. You can only be laughed at if you decide to be a clown in the circus. It's your choice. I'm not an actor who dances at shows or weddings for money. I find it demeaning. I'm not saying that I'm right, but I wouldn't do it, ever.&quot;
&quot;As an actor, you are here to show your craft. How much money do you want to mint? Why is it important to be on a list of the highest earners? What about the audience you are robbing with crap you put out? I have always worked hard for credibility, I get that, I move on quietly. I wish we had more actors cut out from the same fabric,&quot; he added.
3. Anurag Kashyap feels Bollywood is to blame for India's inability to deal with reality
The director has no background or support system from Bollywood. From Varanasi, a few miles away from Wasseypur, Anurag created a stir which was not a commercial venture but in parallel cinema space.
He feels the movies that are made in Bollywood are far from reality which are mostly either shot in the locales of Switzerland or elite studios. In one of the interviews in The Guardian, Anurag said, &quot;I swear as long as there are fucking movies in this country, people will continue to be fooled.&quot;
4. Yami Gautam feels Bollywood is a consuming place
Yami Gautam's latest release is Uri. But she did not have it so easy. Starring in Fair and lovely adverts, Yami was noticed by a filmmaker and since then, there has been no looking back. She likes to focus on her projects without checking out her peers' work.
&quot;It can either take one film or more for someone to be up there. There is no formula for it. When you are up there it is about how you survive and how you handle it, how you take it forward is important. At one point I was a newcomer and there will be new people coming in, if I look left, right and centre I would not be able to focus on my work. It is a very consuming place, it can absorb you, it can drain you emotionally.&quot;
5. Ratna Pathak Shah feels Bollywood has run out of ideas
The actress was recently seen on Netflix in Selection Day. Finally choosing the digital platform, the actress feels Bollywood movies are no longer experimental. &ldquo;I think we have run out of story ideas in films, really. Nobody wants to put money in experimental stories. Even if they want, which is very few in number, they play it safe. They want a star, established names, one or two songs that will help them to promote the content.&rdquo;
6. Tanushree Dutta thinks Bollywood is synonymous with bullshit
Tanushree Dutta started a wave in Bollywood no actor could ever do. Despite not being in the industry for 10 long years, the actress ensured what happened with her a decade ago is out there in the open. The actress, who was labelled as the flag bearer of #MeToo movement, levelled allegations against Nana Patekar for sexually harassing her. She was disappointed how no one stood up for her back then and even now how no action is being taken. Speaking to a leading daily, the actress said,
&quot;No actor stood up for me. No actor has even now. Not a single call or message from any actor. There's just one word that comes to my mind, hypocrisy. Bollywood is synonymous with bullshit. They have bullshitted their way to the top. Worn these guards of righteousness. Everyone is a saint. All you need is a little bit of polishing to be a saint. Everyone is showing by their silence what their actions are.&quot;
7. After the Hrithik epsiode, Kangana felt Bollywood is spineless
She's an outsider and ensured everyone knows the handwork that goes being becoming an insider. The actress made her way up to the top with a lot of hard work and the correct choices in cinema. Kagana reportedly had a brief relationship with Hrithik Roshan and the duo washed their dirty linen in public after their &quot;alleged&quot; break up.
She found the industry spineless as they didn't take a stand. She also started the never ending topic of Nepotism and put the spotlight on Karan Johar. Speaking about her colleagues, Kangana said,
&quot;Even the most successful women want to be liked by others. There is the alluring promise of heaven for those who can love selflessly. It’s fine if they can’t look themselves in the eye, but the world should see them as the epitome of holiness. They (her colleagues) don’t stand up for themselves, forget doing it for others.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
