Yes. Taapsee who’s next film is Badla, said she too has taken a Badla in real life, she revealed,
&ldquo;When I was dating a boy in school he broke up with me by giving 10th board excuse, I felt very bad at that time. After two years, he started flirting with me online and I came to know he was already dating someone but was still flirting with me, so I took the print out of the entire chat and sent it to the girl who he was dating.&rdquo;
