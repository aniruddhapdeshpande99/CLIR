Allegedly, she would send young girls abroad on the pretext of dance and acting assignments. However, the girls would be forced into sex trade there. For every girl, she would receive Rs 40,000, it is said.
According to a report on Times Now, she has been running the sex racket for quite a few years now. It all came to notice, when Kenyan government had deported a trafficked woman recently.
