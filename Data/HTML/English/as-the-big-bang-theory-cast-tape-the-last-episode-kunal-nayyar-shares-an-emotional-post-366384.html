Thank you for your words,Thank you for your encouragement
Thank you for tuning in night in and night out
Thank you for the stories you shared about how this show made you feel
Thank you too, for the not so nice times
Thank you, for lifting us up when we were down
Fame can feel like a cage, so Thank you for making us feel safe enough to be free.
Thank you for letting me share my birthday on stage with my six best friends,
And Thank you, for you, because without you- there would be no us.
So this goes out to you, the fans... One last time.
In love and gratitude, -Kunal&rdquo;
