Alia Bhatt once mentioned that she enjoys memes on her films, in fact she feels memes on the films means itâ€™s a super hit. Wel, she could be right as her last release Gully Boy has some rib-tickling memes and the film turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the year. We hope this continues with Kalank too.

Talking about the trailer, Alia and Varun look promising as a couple, Aditya Roy Kapur indeed mesmerizes us and we can't wait to watch him after a long gap, but Kunal Kemmuâ€™s cameo definitely takes you by surprise. Sanjay Dutt and Madhuru Dixit reunite after almost 2 decades and it seemed like a beautiful reunion. Last but not the least Sonakshi Sinha looked gorgeous and the most beautiful character so far.
The movie is slated to release on 17th April, 2019. Do drop your thoughts or memes about Kalankâ€™s trailer in the comment box below.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
