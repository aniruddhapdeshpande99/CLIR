This film will also see Pratiek Babbar playing as the villain. Talking about his excitement to be a part of Rajini sir’s film, he said to PTI, &ldquo;It is such a dream come true to have bagged this project in such little time. This year is looking very positive for me and Sanya (Sagar) has been such a great influence on my life professionally and personally. I can’t wait to commence shooting with Rajinikanth sir and AR Murugadoss sir this week and create some magic&rdquo;.
We hope the makers manage to shoot their Mumbai portion without any hassle.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
