Shilpa Shetty Hides Under The Sofa When She Sees Her Old Films, Wonders How She Even Got Them!
Photographs, as they say, are pictorial memories. They hold a lot of importance in our lives and teleport us to the good old days. But somewhere, we all get embarrassed to look at our old photos, especially at the way be dressed up, don’t we?

Fashion trends keep evolving. What was considered cool back then, might not be so cool today, right? Shilpa Shetty has a similar story to tell.

While talking about her old days and how rejections made her stronger, she revealed how she hides under the sofa when she sees her old films.

&ldquo;I always felt I am doing the right work. I am hardworking. I hide under the sofa when I see my old films. Back then in films I had blonde hair, used to wear blue lenses and red lipstick. I wonder how I got opportunities,&rdquo; she was quoted as saying by PTI.

Shilpa Shetty believes rejections made her stronger and played a huge part in her success. &ldquo;I think it was all destiny. There is no successful person who hasn't faced failure. The more you get rejected you rise and give your best,&rdquo; she said.

Shilpa Shetty started her career with Baazigar, but she feels the success of the Shah Rukh Khan starrer film didn’t help her in getting good roles thereafter. &ldquo;I did not feel people were accepting me as an actor. Maybe I wasn't that good actor. Even after doing films like 'Phir Milenge' and 'Dhadkan', I never got an award. I felt rejected and bad.&rdquo;

But she kept working hard…
&ldquo;But I kept working hard. There was hunger in my belly... I feel if not for those rejections I wouldn't have lasted so long.&rdquo;
What changed her life was the international reality show Big Brother, she feels.
&ldquo;Big Brother' was a beautiful moment...When I was offered 'Big Brother' I had no clue about the show. There was a certain sense of rejection that I felt to cut away from here and do something away from the country. They were paying me well and I was like let's try. I was prepared to be rejected there also. But every week I got stronger. First time I won something and I was shocked. I feel there is poetic justice and I believe in it.&rdquo;

But today she feels content with whatever she is doing.
&ldquo;I have completed 25 years and I feel the kind of love I am getting today is more as compared to then when I was actively working in films. I don't remember how I became an actress I have forgotten that journey. I feel we are born for a purpose.&quot; After taking a sabbatical from films, Shilpa shifted her focus towards imparting knowledge on health and wellness.&rdquo;

Shilpa Shetty can be seen as a judge on Super Dancer, and she is happy that now people recognise her for the person she is, not for a character she played in some film. &ldquo;TV is gratifying. With TV I am able to connect and entertain,&rdquo; she added.
