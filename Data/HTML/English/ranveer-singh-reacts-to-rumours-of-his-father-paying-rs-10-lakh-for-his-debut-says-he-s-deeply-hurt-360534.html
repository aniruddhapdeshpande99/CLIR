But did you know that rumours are afloat that Ranveer Singh’s father paid Rs 10 lakh to Aditya Chopra for his debut? Rubbishing the rumours and revealing how deeply that hurt him, here’s what Ranveer Singh said on Famously Filmfare.
&ldquo;There were rumours that my father gave Rs 10 lakh to Aditya Chopra, to get me launched. That really hurt me, it brought my whole upbringing into question. How can you write something so false that I had never said? I had genuinely struggled and proud of what I achieved. Young actors will message me and ask, ‘Yo bro, I can cough up the money, tell me what I have to do.’ And I have to say that these rumours are not true, stop believing that!&rdquo;
