10 Years On, India Pays Tribute To The Bravehearts Of 26/11 Who Put Nation Before Themselves
Ten years ago, Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists sailed into Mumbai from Karachi and carried out coordinated terror attacks in Mumbai that lasted for three consecutive days. Several people were trapped; there were bomb explosions and gunfires one after the other. The wave of immense fear ran across the entire nation, which noticed an eerie silence with all eyes glued to the TV sets.
About 166 people died and hundreds of them were injured. But the scars are still afresh and probably it will take a lifetime to heal.
The country salutes those who fought to keep the city safe and saved many lives. The country pays tribute to the victims and the bravehearts who lost their lives.
Ten years after the 26/11 attacks, the entire nation is mourning together.

26/11. We will never forget. What has changed since, Mumbai? Are we any safer? We were promised Police Reforms, counter-terrorism training and modern equipment for a woefully understaffed and underpaid @MumbaiPolice force. Seen any? — VISHAL DADLANI (@VishalDadlani) November 26, 2018

10 years ago, Pakistani terrorists attacked Mumbai & tried to break India.
Thanks to the sacrifices of our brave commandos, police & the resilience of people, this cowardly attack only brought us all closer.
