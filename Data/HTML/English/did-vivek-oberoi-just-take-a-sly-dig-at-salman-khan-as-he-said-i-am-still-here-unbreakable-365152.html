Did Vivek Oberoi Just Take A Sly Dig At Salman Khan As He Said ‘I Am Still Here & Unbreakable'
If ever somebody talks about the feuds in the Indian entertainment industry, seldom one would forget the infamous fight between Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi.
One press conference which Vivek Oberoi called to slam Salman Khan change his fate in the industry. In the press meet, he made the biggest revelation ever. He said Salman Khan called him 41 times and threatened him. What was the reason? Salman Khan’s ex-girlfriend Aishwarya Rai was apparently dating Vivek Oberoi. According to Vivek, Salman was drunk when he called him.
Vivek was reportedly not getting any roles after the incident. He even apologised to Salman Khan on the stage of an award show. But they could never bury the hatched, it seemed.
Vivek was seen as a promising star after he made his debut with Saathiya, but he fell flat post the incident and couldn’t revive his career. Now, that his movie PM Narendra Modi is gearing up for release, he said, &ldquo;I am still here and unbreakable.&rdquo; Did he just take a sly dig at Salman Khan?

&ldquo;I'm the guy whose professional obituaries have been surfacing since 2004. Due or no due, the fact is that I am still here, unbreakable,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by TOI, talking about his career graph. Was that a sly dig at Salman Khan?
AFP
&ldquo;I have worked in six languages and won around 20 awards and I still get some great work to do. Instead of being in the rat-race, and running to the finishing line, I am spending time watching my kids grow. Acting gives me joy, but so does playing football in the garden with my son and lighting up my daughter's doll-house with her. I am on crazy schedule even now, but I don't miss a chance to feed my bachchas and break bread with my wife and parents,&rdquo; he added.
While Vivek at various instances has praised Salman Khan, the latter usually dodges the question. Will they ever be able to sort out their differences?
