Dhawan had even posted an adorable picture with Natasha on the occasion of Diwali this year, giving out another hint that he's dating her.
And now, while we are rejoicing about all the celebrity weddings that happened and are scheduled to happen in December, looks like this couple too is taking things ahead in a similar direction.
Varun and Natasha were spotted at the Mumbai airport today with Daddy Varun Dhawan as they flew out of the city. The couple and Daddy Dhawan posed for the paps and smiled. The pictures made way on the internet and like always, everyone has a similar reaction: When's the wedding?
