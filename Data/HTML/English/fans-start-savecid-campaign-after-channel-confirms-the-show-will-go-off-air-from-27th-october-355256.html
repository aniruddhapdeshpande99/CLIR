Fans Start #SaveCID Campaign After Channel Confirms The Show Will Go Off Air From 27th October
There can't be anything more heartbreaking for a television fan other than knowing that their favourite TV Show CID is now coming to an end. After entertaining India for over two decades, the reports of CID going off air got confirmed recently.
Sony TV
Dayanand Shetty, who plays the role of Daya in the show went on to confirm this news to TOI. The last episode of the show will air on 27th October 2018. In an interview with TOI, Dayanand Shetty said,
Sony TV
&quot;We were in our 21st year and had we shot for a few more episodes, we would have entered our 22nd year. It is quite an unfortunate thing to happen as we were shooting like always and suddenly we were informed by our producer that the shooting has been called off indefinitely because there were issues with the channel.&quot;
Talking about the fact that he is going to miss the show sorely, he added,
Sony TV
Don't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.5 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES
&quot;I am going to miss the character, but we feel sad for the audience as they enjoyed the show and it was doing well. The entire cast and crew is very dedicated towards their work and we are like a big happy family. We are going to miss each other as this was our second home.&quot;
That's not all. Not just stars are crestfallen with this news. The fans of the show have even started a #SaveCID campaign on social media. Expressing what the show means to them, they want the channel to retain this show.

It's not a goodbye yaar #cid an iconic show of 21 years. @SonyTV if you really want to end that show don't you think this show must have a glorifying end. Cid is the reason behind all your success don't you feel it is important to have a respectful ending.#savecid ,#Donotendcid pic.twitter.com/ymr7Ovi4fV â€” Anupama Mishra (@Anupama27416972) October 22, 2018
@SonyTV
None of us are gonna watch your damn channel if CID gets off-aired! Remember those days when you had nothing to broadcast and it was CID who established your channel! We don't care about your other damn shows, we want CID back.#saveCID @shivaajisatam @SonyLIV #CID â€” Rasil Adhikari (@rasil_adhikari) October 23, 2018</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
