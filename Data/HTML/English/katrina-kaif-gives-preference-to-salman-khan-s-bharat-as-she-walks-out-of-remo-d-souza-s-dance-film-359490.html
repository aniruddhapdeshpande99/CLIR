&quot;Katrina Kaif had to opt out of Remo D'Souza's upcoming dance film owing to her hectic schedule for 'Bharat'. Katrina has always been a thorough professional. She decided to step out of the film as her dates were clashing with 'Bharat', which she is currently shooting for,&quot; Katrina's official spokesperson said in a statement.
The dance film to be produced by Bhushan Kumar's T-Series, is touted to be India's biggest dance film. The yet-to-be-titled film also features actor-choreographer-director Prabhudeva, Dharmesh Yelande, Raghav Juyal and Punit Pathak. The project was scheduled to release in November, 2019.
