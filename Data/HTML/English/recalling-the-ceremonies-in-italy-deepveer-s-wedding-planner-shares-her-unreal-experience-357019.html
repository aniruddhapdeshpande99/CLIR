Not that we haven't seen them together before but the 'after-wedding' glow and happiness of starting their journey together is well evident. The couple has started making their public appearance in India after returning from Italy and people can't help but gush and adore all these pictures.
From Ranveer being a protective 'boyfriend turned husband' to Deepika Padukone laughing when paps address them as 'Baba and Bhabhiji', looks like their love will make them rule on the internet for weeks.
Apart from the pictures from their private wedding that found its way on the internet, the ones where their teams have posted with them remain the sweetest ones. Everyone had great things to share about the couple and the wedding.

Considering how the couple made sure that they have all these special people around them is a fact that their love and respect for people who work for them is uncompromising.
Another group photo that was shared two days ago was by DeepVeer's wedding planning team.
The head of the company, Vandana took to her Instagram to share the unadulterated feeling of joy and ecstasy that she felt while handling this project and then seeing the couple exchange vows and tie the knot.
In another post from Italy, Vandana wrote,
&quot;They looked unreal, for time stood still. The first glimpse of them was as though they had walked out from the realms of a historical land towards their future together... Amidst us all, they stole a moment for themselves and when they both looked at each other and smiled, one knew it was as pure as any emotion could be : LOVE ❤️&quot;
After making their public appearance at the Mumbai airport and Ranveer's home in Bandra, the couple has landed in Bengaluru today, where they are all set to host their first wedding reception.
