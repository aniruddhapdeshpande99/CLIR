&quot;The thing is I never made a film for myself, Himesh Reshammiya made a film for himself, everybody made films for themselves, I didn’t launch myself, people came to me, so they must have seen something in me. They had seen me performing in my music videos, so they found something in me and came to me, but the films didn’t do well, even Thugs Of Hindostan didn’t work, that doesn’t make Aamir Khan or Amitabh Bachchan a bad actor.

&quot;Films not working is a different thing, I know what I am, public perception doesn’t matter to me at all. There are people who do not even deserve to be on screen and you guys are still watching them.&rdquo;

Nigam admits acting wouldn’t take him places so he stopped for good, &ldquo; Also I lead a very busy and productive life, to invest 100 days for a film without even knowing the outcome is not good for me, the actors can afford this, if I do this I will be missing out from music and concerts. I have a career running, I can’t afford a Thugs Of Hindostan, Aamir or Amitabh will start something again because they are only actors. I am not only an actor, people are expecting so much of music from me, how can I give time to something which doesn’t have any guarantee, so that is why I didn’t allow anyone to give me a movie. Even now I get lots of offers but I don’t do it.&quot;
