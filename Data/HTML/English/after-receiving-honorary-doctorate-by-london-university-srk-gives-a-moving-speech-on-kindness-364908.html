&ldquo;I believe that charity should be done in silence and with dignity. One cannot speak about their charitable acts because it loses its purpose. I have been privileged to be able to use my status as a public personality to champion causes close to my heart. I actively participate with the causes of women empowerment, rehabilitation of the underprivileged and basic human rights.&quot;
He added,
&ldquo;I firmly believe that I have to give back to the world that has given me so much. I am humbled with this Honorary Doctorate bestowed upon me and would like to thank everyone involved for choosing me.&quot;
