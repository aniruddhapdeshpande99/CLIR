Earlier this year when Christopher Nolan had come to India, he said that he heard about the grand success of the Aamir Khan starrer. He told India Today he was honoured and would watch the film soon.
Aamir Khan‚Äôs Thugs of Hindostan might have miserably failed at the box office this year, but how can we forget the fact that Aamir Khan is the first member of the 100 crore club (Ghajini), 200 hundred crore film (3 Idiots) and also the 300 crore club (PK) at the domestic box office.
And it all started with Ghajini.
It was ten years ago, on Christmas, that this masterpiece, which was a remake of 2005 Tamil psychological thriller film of the same name, had released. For the first time, Aamir Khan who is known to be Mr Perfectionist attempted what‚Äôs called a masala entertainer. He worked hard on his physique and the unique hairstyle that he sported went on to become a trend.

Along with that, Aamir Khan, who is known for releasing his films on Christmas, is also celebrating the ninth anniversary of 3 Idiot‚Äôs release. Aamir Khan starrer film that takes on the insane craze for admission in IIT colleges and getting an engineering degree in India, inspired a lot of people to follow their dreams.
Remembering how Aamir Khan films have always been a game-changer for Bollywood, fans are overwhelmed.

Oh yes ! I've met people who didn't like 3 Idiots at all and Ghajini - like you said, underwhelming. But I feel they were fun films that never bored. Damn, Kalpana's murder still haunts me. It was so terrrifying ! ‚Äî Nived Nambiar (@Nived_Nambiar91) December 25, 2018

It's been 10 years since 'short term memory loss' patient Sanjay Singhania avenged his girlfriend Kalpana Shetty's brutal murder. #Ghajini
And nine years since terms 'Prerajulisation' & 'Farhannitrate' was coined by Ranchoddas Shymaldas Chanchad a.k.a Baba Rancho. #3Idiots ‚Äî Nived Nambiar (@Nived_Nambiar91) December 25, 2018

Aamir Khan‚Äôs Thugs Of Hindostan might have failed at the box office, but how can we forget that he changed the face of Indian Cinema with all his films including Lagaan, Taare Zameen Par and Rang De Basanti. Last year, Dangal crossed Rs 1000 crore at the worldwide box office.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
