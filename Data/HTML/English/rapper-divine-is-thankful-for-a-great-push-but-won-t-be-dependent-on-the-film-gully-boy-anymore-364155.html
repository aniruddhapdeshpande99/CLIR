&ldquo;The movie was a great push for us but we should not be dependent on the movie anymore. We should do our own thing. A mainstream movie came about us and now everybody knows about this scene in Mumbai&rdquo;.
Divine who is a hip hop star and a well-known face all over the world wants that there should be a Gully Boy from every city and not only Mumbai, &ldquo; Now every city should be pushing and putting themselves out there because now there is an audience who is ready to listen&rdquo;.
The rapper was even quizzed about the sequel of Gully Boy which Zoya had already confirmed she is doing, he said, &ldquo;I didn't have a word with her (Zoya) yet. If she's doing one then all the best to her. She has my love already&rdquo;.
