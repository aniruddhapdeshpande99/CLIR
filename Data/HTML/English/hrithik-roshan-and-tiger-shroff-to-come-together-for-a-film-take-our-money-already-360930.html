Hrithik Roshan And Tiger Shroff To Come Together For A Film. Take Our Money Already!
There are some collaborations that leave fans all excited and Hrithik Roshan & Tiger Shroff coming together for a film is definitely one of them. The two actors will be sharing screen space for the first time.
On Hrithik's birthday, Tiger Shroff had expressed his admiration for him and now the two actors are collaborating for a Yash Raj Films' production. When Tiger was asked if the audience would get to see a dance-off between the two in the film, he said,
Instagram
&quot;I think that's what the audience is expecting and we are going to give exactly that to them and we are we are going to give lot more so, audience can expect the best.&quot;
Tiger added that Hrithik is in his top form. He said,
Instagram
&quot;Hrithik sir is coming in top form. I have seen him train day and night, I have seen him work hard on a set and I have seen his work ethic so, I think, if he is not the same as he was in Kaho Na Pyaar Hai, he must be even better and younger looking now.&quot;
Tiger, who is the son of actor Jackie Shroff, says he would like to see the remake of Parinda being made because that is his favorite film of his father. He said,
Don't Miss 3.1 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES
&quot;It was one of the best roles in his career. I don't think I will be ready to be part of it because I can't match up tp my father but if that film is being remade, I would love to watch it.&quot;
