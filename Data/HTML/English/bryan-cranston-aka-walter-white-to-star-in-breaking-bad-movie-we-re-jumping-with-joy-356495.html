&ldquo;Yes, there appears to be a movie version of 'Breaking Bad', but honestly I have not even read the script. I have not gotten the script, I have not read the script. And so, there's the question of whether or not we'll even see Walter White in this movie. Ohhhhh! Think about that one...
&quot;There's a lot of people who felt that they wanted to see some kind of completion to some of these storylines that were left on. And this idea, from what I'm told, gets into those at least a couple of the characters who were not completed as far as their journey,&rdquo; the actor said on The Dan Patrick Show.
What’s more, he called Breaking Bad as &quot;the greatest professional period of my life&quot; and said he would love to come back.
&ldquo;There is an appearance, or what kind of appearance flashbacks, flash-forwards, I have no clue. But I'm excited about it because it's 'Breaking Bad' and it was, and I can't wait to see all those people again, even if I just come by to visit.&rdquo;
