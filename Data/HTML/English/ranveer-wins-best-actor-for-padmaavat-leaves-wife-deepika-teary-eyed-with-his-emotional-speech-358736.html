They say true love is when you want to see your better half grow and achieve all that he/she wants in life. To be just standing beside him/her and seeing him/her beaming with happiness is a feeling out of this world. Isn't it?
As they say, your life changes when you fall in love, we see the same happening with much-in-love couple Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, who are now man and wife.
