It wasn't a usual comeback with a film but she ended up becoming the unintentional torch-bearer of #MeToo movement in India. After she shared her ordeal, there were many women who came out and shared their stories of harassment and injustice.
In a recent interview with Mid-day, Tanushree added how the industry is at least making an honest attempt to adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual harassment. She said,
&quot;People have been conditioned to think that it's okay for men to behave inappropriately and actresses have to compromise without complaining. Fortunately, the newer generation is opinionated and will phase out the patriarchal thinking. People have been dropped from projects, studios have become careful to not hire names that are accused.&quot;
But she is still very disappointed that there are actresses who failed to come out to share their stories. She added,
&quot;It wasn't hard to miss how several big names maintained a studied silence on the subject. Point out the dichotomy, and she says, it's disappointing that not many actresses have spoken up on the matter. They probably gave themselves over to their ambitions. Some stories of Swara [Bhasker] and Kangana's [Ranaut] struggles have been chronicled, but several others disappeared.&quot;
While Tanushree has filed a complaint against Nana Patekar, things have not moved as they should have by now.
