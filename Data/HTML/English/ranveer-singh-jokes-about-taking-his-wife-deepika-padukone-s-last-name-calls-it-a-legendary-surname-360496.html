DeepVeer fans were waiting for Deepika Padukone to change her surname to Singh, just like Priyanka Chopra, Sonam Kapoor and Neha Dhupia did shortly after their wedding. When she was asked about the same in one of her interviews, she joked and said Ranveer Singh will change his name to Ranveer Singh Padukone.

In fact, she also admitted that she has never even discussed changing surnames with Ranveer.
&ldquo;After that interview, I realized that it’s a conversation Ranveer and I’ve never even had. So, we haven’t been like, ‘oh, do you think you should change your surname?’... It has never crossed either of our minds. When I was asked about it, I was like, ‘oh, we haven’t even thought about it,&rdquo; she was quoted as saying by India TV.
