&ldquo;So much sympathy for a millionaire losing work? So much empathy for his privileged family being â€˜torturedâ€™?How about the scores of girls & women he tortured?Multiple testimonies not proof enough?&rdquo;
She added:
1)Not 1 but possibly ðŸ’¯+ women & MEN can attest to Anu Malikâ€™s deplorable abusive behaviour.
2)I guess Mr. Sonu Nigam expects all these women/underage girls to - a)strap recording devices b)carry spy cams,other proof gathering devices cus they have much to benefit defaming him? https://t.co/2udQ71S70a â€” SONA (@sonamohapatra) December 19, 2018

It was during the #MeToo movement in India that many who were in power in the film industry were called out for their inappropriate conduct. One of these men was Anu Malik, who was accused by several women of asking for sexual favours from women.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
