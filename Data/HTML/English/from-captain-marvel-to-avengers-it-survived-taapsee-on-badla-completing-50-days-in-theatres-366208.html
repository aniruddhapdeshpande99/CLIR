From Captain Marvel To Avengers, It Survived, Taapsee On Badla Completing 50 Days In Theatres!
Just a few weeks ago, Megastar Amitabh Bachchan expressed that he was upset that not enough has been said on the &quot;silent success&quot; of his latest film &quot;Badla&quot;, directed by Sujoy Ghosh and produced by Shah Rukh Khan.
&quot;About time someone started talking about this silent success! Because neither the producer, nor the distributor, nor the line producer, or any else in the industry, in general, has even spent a nano second to compliment the success of this film 'Badla'. Thank you,&quot; Big B tweeted.
Shah Rukh, known for his quick wit, responded: &quot;Sir hum toh wait kar rahein hain ki aap party kab de rahein hain hum sabko (Sir, we are waiting for you to throw a party for all of us! We are waiting outside Jalsa every night!&quot;
Well, the social media banter continued and just like that, the film has managed to complete a successful run of 50 days at the box-office. Starring Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee Pannu in the lead roles, the film has been the surprise package of the year in terms of monetary success! While it started slow, it's pleasantly surprising how the positive word of mouth worked for the film.
