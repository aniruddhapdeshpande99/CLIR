Akshay began his speech in Tamil amid a loud cheer from the audiences. He said he practiced for two hours to speak in Tamil. Quickly switching to English, Akshay said: &quot;I can't express my feelings in words. I'm really thankful to Shankar sir and Lyca Productions for this opportunity.&quot;
Talking about his role, he said, &quot;It was a very challenging role and it took a toll on my body. But the pain and sacrifice was worth it. My character required around 4 hours of prosthetic make-up and another hour and a half to remove it. In my whole career, I've never put so much of make-up.&quot;
