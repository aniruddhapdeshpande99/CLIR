&ldquo;I don't understand what is their (Pakistan) agenda and what will they get out of it by constantly sponsoring terrorism. It's an open truth that they support terrorist organisations but they are constantly denying it,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by IANS.
&ldquo;Masood Azhar (the founder and leader of the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed) was released from Indian prison when they (Jaish-e-Mohammed) hijacked an Indian aircraft and then, how he reached Pakistan from Kandahar (Afghanistan)... And why is Pakistan not arresting him if they have an honest establishment over there,&rdquo; he questioned.
He says the situation is being forced upon India and questioned as to how many times we shall remain silent.

&ldquo;I feel this situation is actually being forced upon us (India). It was not our choice but if things go beyond your control, then till when and how many times should we be quiet about this? So, we have to react to it some day or the other.
&ldquo;I think repercussions of the current developments are really dangerous and banning Pakistani actors and artistes are minor things but whatever is happening on our borders should be stopped. We should ban terrorism. It's an unfortunate thing.&rdquo;
