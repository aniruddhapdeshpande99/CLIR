It was a year ago that #MeToo movement had kickstarted in the US snowballing into a global call by women across the world. It reached India too, after Tanushree Dutta once again accused Nana Patekar of sexually harassing her about ten years ago and revealing that it led her to quitting Bollywood for good. Right after this big revelation, a domino effect was recorded that led to one woman after the other to call out the sexual predators who harassed them at some point.
