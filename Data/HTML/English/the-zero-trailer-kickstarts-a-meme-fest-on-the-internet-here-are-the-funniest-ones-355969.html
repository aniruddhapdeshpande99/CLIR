The Zero Trailer Kickstarts A Meme Fest On The Internet. Here Are The Funniest Ones!
For many of us, birthday rituals include getting presents from people we love. However, in the case of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, this ritual gets a little tweaked as he prefers giving return gifts to his fans by releasing trailers of his films. This might be a good way of exploiting an opportunity but has SRK been able to hit gold with it?
Well, the answer to it is tricky and most of his recent films have failed to impress the audience.
Red Chillies
SRK turned 53 on Friday and he launched the trailer of his much-anticipated movie Zero at an IMAX theatre in Mumbai.
Directed by Aanand L Rai, the film stars SRK, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma in lead roles. The three-minute long-trailer is packed with emotions and drama and some dialogues like:
&quot;Plot dekhne ke paise thodi lagte hain.&quot;
&quot;Out!&quot;
&quot;Bahot milenge thumhaare jaise.&quot;
&quot;Ganwar pasand hai mujhe.&quot;
&quot;Lena hai hume.&quot;
While the verdict on the trailer might not be very favourable but you can't ignore the meme-fest that fans started. We picked up the funniest ones. Read on!
