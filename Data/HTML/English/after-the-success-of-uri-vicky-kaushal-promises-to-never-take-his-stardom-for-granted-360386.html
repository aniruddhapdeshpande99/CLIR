In conversation with Indiatimes, Vicky spoke about the success of Uri, his game changer film, stardom and more.
To begin with, he spoke about Uriâ€™s success. Feeling thankful, Vicky said, &quot;This kind of response was pleasantly surprising for all of us, we were hoping to get a good response but we didnâ€™t think that even Friday evening shows would be full and the numbers will be so good. The claps are the biggest compliment for me from the audience; you get the claps in the theatres only when they feel connected.&ldquo;
We quizzed him what excites him as an actor and he said, &ldquo;I get excited when I do not have dialogue luxury to express my feelings, but still I have to express my feelings, so as an actor, there is a scope of proving yourself and it is a self-test period too.&rdquo;.

The Best Phase Where I'm Getting Good Directors And Amazing Scripts
Now Vicky has made his mark in the list of bankable actor and whatever he touches is turning into gold. So how is he planning to encash it, to which he said, &ldquo;I donâ€™t think I need to encash it. I will continue the same process of my work like I have been doing it, I want to be truthful to my work and thatâ€™s very important for me. But now is the time, I cannot lose focus, I cannot take this success for granted, I have to put a lot more hard work, I will not take success or failure very seriously, Itâ€™s a good phase for me where I am getting to work with good directors and good scripts. &ldquo;

Never Want To Be Stereotyped
The actor reveals how after Masaan, he got the offers in the same genre, but he never did that and rather chose a totally opposite film.
&ldquo;I have been selective from the beginning. After Masaan, I got a lot of roles based out of UP or Bihar, which I tried to stay away from. Then I did a film like Raman Raghav, where I knew, it is not for the masses, but at least I will get to show that I can do a lot more. I never wanted to be to be stereotyped. I always believe that Industry or audience don't stereotype you; itâ€™s you who make yourself, thatâ€™s your choice. I always try to be different from my on-screen characters; I never want to repeat myself. Even now I am shooting for a horror film, so thatâ€™s my agenda, that I do everything, rest is destiny.&rdquo;

Sanju Was Definitely A Game Changer
Vicky feels Sanju bought him all the fame, &ldquo;Masaan gave me a lot of credibility, because it was such an underdog film, nobody had any expectation from it, but when it came, people were surprised. Masaan opened a lot of doors for me, but with Sanju, I could reach every audienceâ€™s house, I got a bigger base and spread with Sanju.&rdquo;

For Me, The Only Hero In A Film Is The Script
Vicky has done multi-starrer and two hero films too, when asked if he is looking forward to do a solo hero film, he said, &ldquo;I want to be a part of the film where a script is the hero and nothing else. My conscious effort is to not repeat myself, If I have done that genre, I donâ€™t want to follow it immediately, I will take a break from it, thatâ€˜s the first aspect. And the other thing is when I read a script, I donâ€™t read it as an actor, I try to listen to or read an audience, I think in my mind that I have paid 300 rupees for this film, so after the reading, if I feel that I should tell about this story to more people, and I get excited by the character, then I will do it or else I wonâ€™t do it. &ldquo;

It's A Privilege In This Industry To Be Pressurized
Now that Vicky has become a huge star, there is a lot of expectations from him as an actor. &ldquo;There is a pressure and itâ€™s a good pressure because that pressure will bring the best work out of me. And I have worked very hard to get that pressure on me, because being pressured by the audience is a privilege because if there is no pressure means they donâ€™t love you and donâ€™t care about you. I have knocked 1000 of doors to get this pressure; I am not letting this go.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
