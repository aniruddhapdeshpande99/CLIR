While fans are disjointed with the news, a few people have strongly reacted to it.
After a prolonged deafening silence of people over the issues, a very few have actually come out and spoken about it.
Dia Mirza, a close friend of Hirani who's worked with him in Lage Raho Munnabhai and Sanju , reacted with stupefied confusion.
Twitter
&quot;I am deeply distressed by this news. As someone who has known and respects Raju sir for 15 years, I can only hope that a due official inquiry is conducted. He is one of the most decent human beings I have ever worked with and I think it would be grossly unjust on my part to speak on this as I do not know the details,&quot; Dia said.
After Sanju actress Dia Mirza called it 'deeply depressing', actor Sharman Joshi, who has worked with Hirani in the epic hit 3 Idiots, has spoken out on the issue.

Apart from Sharman Joshi, Arshi Warsi too has reacted over the matter.
Arshad Warsi, who played Circuit in Hirani's Munna Bhai franchise, said,
Twitter
&quot;If you talk to me about Raju Hirani as a person, as a personality and how he is, I think he is a wonderful person and a thorough gentleman. So, for me, Itâ€™s a shocker as it is for everybody else who has heard this news.&quot;
Everyone is questioning Bollywood's silence over the accusations.
