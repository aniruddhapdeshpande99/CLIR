Since they tagged SRK in their tweet, the superstar was able to see this and wrote 'God bless you' ! SRK's reply is a sweet one as he extended wishes for the newlyweds. While Khan was obviously not a part of the wedding, he made sure they feel special.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
