Bollywood superstars Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone, have now officially tied the knot in konkani style ceremony in the picturesque location of Italy.
In a three day event of wedding festivity, #DeepVeer as fans love to call them, got engaged on Day 1 and then got hitched in a day ceremony.
And it's heartbreaking for everyone back in the home country that none of us have gotten our hands on any visuals of the same. From designers, fans and friends, everyone is eager to know how the wedding is rolling, and how Deepika and Ranveer are looking as man and wife.

As per reports, heavy patrolling is done in and around their wedding venue and celebs, family, staff and florists are all required to submit their phones at the entrance to avoid any pictures getting leaked.
Following into the footsteps of Rani Mukerji and Aditya Chopra, Deepika-Ranveer have so far managed to be successful. However, social media is pleading the A-listers to release a few photos. Take a look
