4. Aamir Khan Said Sorry, Katrina Kaif Is Hurt – Thugs Of Hindostan Cast Addresses Film's Failure
&ldquo;I know Aamir has spoken on the matter and it has really hurt deeply and personally. Disappointment is always good as it wakes you up little bit again. In case of 'Thugs…' it was not for lack of trying, something just went wrong in case of 'Thugs of Hindostan'. You need to have guts and urge to try things and be prepared it may or may not work,&rdquo; she was quoted as saying by PTI.
&quot;A film like this not only requires complete creative freedom but also the belief and support of its producer, and I got that abundantly from Sanjay Routray and Matchbox Pictures. Looking forward to more such collaborations.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
