Most of us derive the definition of love from movies. Oodles of clichéd masala, sprinkles of Raj, butterflies in the stomach, secret glances, the glint in the eyes, tumultuous life turning into a cakewalk – love is a feeling out of this world!

But does that happen in real life? To break your bubble – Raj is a myth, Rahul would be quite annoying in real-life, best friends usually don’t give a shit about your personal life, poor guys never turn rich in an instant, the geek usually remains a geek and also he doesn’t get the chick, road trips are mesmerising but not hassle-free, club isn’t the place to find love anymore, and weddings are full of anxiety and never excitement – these expectations derived from reel-life have ruined our real lives!

So, what is love? Is there even a definition? It is one of the most profound emotions that are difficult to put into words. And each love story is different. Yes, it is.
Love is a strange feeling and it has different definitions for different people. Love has no boundaries, no limits. It knows no age or barriers.
With time Bollywood is learning that. Here are some of the movies that showed different shades of love!

Have you ever been in love with someone who helps you find yourself but also kills a part of you? Manmarziyaan showed us the violent side of love. The Anurag Kashyap directorial explored the feeling called love beautifully giving it a refreshing colour. Three lost souls rediscover themselves while dismantling the romanticism of eternal love.
#2 Love flows free -- Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga
&ldquo;Ankhiyan de kol reh jaane de… Kehna hai jo keh jaane de... Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga&rdquo;
Twitter
Rajkummar Rao and Sonam Kapoor starrer love story Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga is a complete fairytale romantic film but with a twist. The princess charming does come into her life to save the day and make it even more beautiful. Showing homosexual love story and struggles to find acceptance for it in the family and society, this movie definitely caught us off-guard and in the best possible way.
#3 Love knows no age – Once Again
YouTube
Love can happen at any age. Netflix India Original film starring Shefali Shah and Neeraj Kabi, Once Again is a story about grown-up love. It’s a mature love story about two people with different lifestyles living in Mumbai who find love in each other’s life. Shefali Shah plays a widow and is struggling to get her son married, but she herself falls in love with a man who has all the luxuries in life except for his daughter, whose custody he fails to get post divorce. It’s definitely a film worth watching once again.
#4 Love is not lost after marriage -- Badhaai Ho
Twitter
Badhaai Ho was one of the most loved films of 2018. It talks about a subject that has never been talked about before – sex life of parents. What happens when a man (played by Ayushmann Khurrana) finds out that his mother is pregnant. This movie was a game-changer especially for Indian audiences, for whom the idea of their parents having sexual desires is somewhat alien. Parents make love too – this film helped in normalising such discussions.
#5 The unusual love story – October

October isn’t a story about love at first sight. It’s not about kisses and hugs and promises. It’s an unusual love story about selfless love. This thought-provoking story revolves around interns who are going through the usual grind but suddenly an accident changes their lives forever. Danish and Shuili haven’t shared a great camaraderie before but after she goes into coma, he leaves no stone unturned to help her. But why? Maybe because of love – not a conventional one for sure. The movie leaves behind so many open-ended questions.
#6 Modern day interpretation of Heer Raanjha -- Raanjhana
Twitter
Not a fairytale romance, Raanjhana is an epic modern day romantic movie that has reinterpreted the romance of Heer and Raanjha in modern-day context. Love doesn’t always come easy. Sometimes it's one-sided too. A man sacrifices his life for a girl who never reciprocated the feeling he had for her. She might not have loved him in the way he wanted, but she stands to avenge his death until the very end.
#7 A tale of longing, a love story about lovers who never meet -- The Lunchbox
Youtube
A way to man’s heart is through his stomach, they say. In an unconventional way, this story somewhere proves the same.

The Lunchbox is a story about two middle-aged people who never meet but are connected by a lunchbox delivery company. They exchange notes to build their own fantasy world. It’s a love story that doesn’t have any cynicism.
#8 A heart-warming tale of love, loss and acceptance – Masaan
&ldquo;Tu kissi rail se guzarti hai, mai kisi pull sa thar-tharaata hun&rdquo;
YouTube
If you have watched Masaan, you would know that it’s a hard-hitting story about life, death, broken dreams, desperation, bravery and hope. The movie reveals how sometimes things or some people can only find a place in your heart and not in life. You have to accept that and move on. Just like hate, love can be a baggage too.
#9 The innocence of arranged love – Dum Laga Ke Haisha
