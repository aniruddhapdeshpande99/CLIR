Jahnvi said her personal growth has been tremendous and she has emerged stronger in the trying times.
&ldquo;It’s harder to say anything… When I say growth’, I mean personal growth, I don’t know about artistic. This year brought me both the worst and the best experience of my life. It’s a little strange… Our family is now united, so that is very big thing for me. But whatever happened that too was very heavy (tragedy). We are still in shock, so we haven’t been able to process it properly. I’m really thankful for all the love that we have received and I got a chance to work, which is a big thing for me. I got a chance to make my parents proud, which is most important for me,&rdquo; she said during a session at the ongoing International Film Festival of India (IFFI).
