Taimur Ali Khan Trumps Ranveer Singh! Kareena Kapoor Says Her Son Is More Stylish Than Him
All kids are cute and adorable, right? We know, how often you wonder why paparazzi’s favourite Taimur Ali Khan makes headlines every now and then. But did you know that his parents, Saif Ali Khan and Taimur Ali Khan, fight over the two-year-old’s looks?

Don’t believe us? Saif had once admitted to it. &ldquo;She (Kareena) says he looks like me but I am pretty sure he looks a lot like her. I cannot tell. Some days he looks like me and some days he looks like her. He looks like a Chinese her… Not Chinese, let’s say Mongol. But Mongol sounds like he is missing a chromosome. Let’s say Timurid,&rdquo; he had said.

Now, as he is growing up, he is turning out to be a star in his own right. Remember when he was clicked in a printed Kurta and green sunglasses, people compared his style statement with Ranveer Singh. We know, he is just a kid and perhaps doesn’t know/care about it yet. But nothing can stop the internet.
