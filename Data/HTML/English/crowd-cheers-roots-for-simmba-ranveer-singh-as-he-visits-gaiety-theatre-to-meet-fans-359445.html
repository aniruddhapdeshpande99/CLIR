After giving a phenomenal and intense performance in January in Padmaavat, the actor is now all set to woo the audience with his first true-blue masala entertainer!
Ranveer's Simmba has hit the theatres today and excitement is at peak for both audience and Singh himself. He can't contain and his excitement and during the promotions of his film, he once said,
&ldquo;Thereâ€™s romance, comedy, action and drama and the drama is intense. Not too many people understand how painstaking it is to make masala films. Not enough credit is given to the makers of the genre. I think come Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I will definitely be there in single screen theatres like Chandan, Gaiety-Galaxy, celebrating because there is no greater trip when you watch with the live audience and Simmba is that film.
Even during Padmaavat I would sneak into theatres and watch the film with the audience and I would be amazed to see them cheering for Khilji, the villain. I live for it. All things aside, I will have that experience.
When you are in the hall and when you see the audience clapping, whistling, dancing in the aisles, roaring with laughter, going up on the screen and dancing, I am that audience, I have done it time and again. I did it in Paris for Salman Khan's Sultan. I am 100 per cent going to do it.&quot;
