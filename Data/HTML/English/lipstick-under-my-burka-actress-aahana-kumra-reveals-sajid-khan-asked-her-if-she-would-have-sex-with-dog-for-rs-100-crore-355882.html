Aahana Kumra Reveals Sajid Khan Asked Her If She Would Have Sex With Dog For Rs 100 Crore
Bollywood actress Aahana Kumra might be one big film old but she had been struggling to get the right project for quite a few years. Being a non-star kid, the actress faced a fair share of struggles.
In an interview with Bombay Times, Aahana revealed some details about her life and also spoke about the on-going #MeToo movement.
Aahana narrates how Bollywood disillusioned her when she was starting out 5 years ago.
&quot;I was on the verge of committing suicide, because this culture is so normalised by certain people. I couldn't live with who I was anymore. I started questioning myself about who I had become. I was not what my parents expected me to be. It has taken me a lot to come out of it,&quot; she said.
Aahana recalls how she got sucked into a group of people who do the kind of things that you are not conditioned to do.

&quot;I will not deny the fact that I was in bad company. I had to consciously steer away from it, as I realised that it will take me down badly. There were some people from a known production house, who were part of my circle, but today, they are not my friends anymore.&quot;
The actress even spoke about the much talked movement and accused Anirbhan Blah and Sajid Khan of sexual harassment. Agreeing with Saloni Chopra who has charged allegations against Housefull director, Aahana said it's a drill for Sajid to call aspiring actresses to his house.
About her encounter with Sajid Khan, Aahana said, &quot;I had a meeting with Sajid Khan about a year ago, knowing the fact that he is a shady guy. I met him and he did the same thing that Saloni (Chopra) has written about him. Same drill — you go to his house, you are escorted to his room which is pretty dark. He makes you watch what he’s watching. He did not make a pass at me, but he said that he wanted to get to know me. When I asked him why we can’t sit outside, he said his mother was sitting there so why trouble her.
I asked him to switch on the lights of the room, which he did. You have to be assertive here. He wanted to chat with me. I told him my mom’s a police officer which I think made him behave. But he still asked me bizarre questions like, ‘Would you have sex with a dog if I gave you `100 crores’?
He didn’t touch me. I guess he was trying to give me gyaan on how I need to be a dumbf*** or laugh at his sexist jokes, if I wanted to be a mainstream heroine in his films. He implied that I think too much and that I am too vocal about what I think. Hence, I am not mainstream actress material. Point being, you can meet anyone, but be wise about who you work with.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
