Old Wine In A New Bottle? Fans Think â€˜Simmbaâ€™ Is A Recycled Version Of Dabangg & Singham!
Flying cars, high voltage action and lots of drama, Rohit Shetty movies are commercial potboilers which are over-the-top but high on the fun element.
The man is back in action with yet another action fuelled drama in the Singham series. This time with Ranveer Singh, Ajay Devgn and Sara Ali Khan starrer Simmba â€“ and going by the trailer, the movie looks like a complete dose of masala entertainment.
Ranveer Singh who is known for his eccentric vibe and crazy energy is playing the lead role in the movie. He plays the role of a corrupt police officer who takes on rapists. His one-liners and punches have caught people's fancy.
Sonu Sood and Ashutosh Rana are also a part of the movie. Sara Ali Khan is playing Ranveerâ€™s love interest, and there is original Singham AKA Ajay Devgn in the movie too. Take a look at the trailer below.

But wait, isnâ€™t this giving you a feeling of DÃ©jÃ  vu? Simmba trailer looks like a mix of Dabangg and Singham, donâ€™t you think? Well, people on social media think so.
Simmba is just Rohit Shetty retweeting Singham â€” P.R. (@pr_akash_raj) December 3, 2018
@ajaydevgn's screen presence is incredible..His 10sec. Appearance is the main highlight of 2:54 minute Trailer...#SimmbaTrailer â€” Jon Snow (@Rohits_Pull) December 3, 2018
#SimmbaTrailer has nothing new to serve to the audience. I love Ranveer Singh but he doesn't have that aggression which we have seen in Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan. Rohit Shetty is doing the same thing yet again and i am DISAPPOINTED ! @RanveerOfficial #SimmbaTrailer â€” Siddharth Mathur (@TheSidMathur) December 3, 2018

#SIMMBATRAILER sucks, sucks and just sucks. That's all. â€” Aaliyaan Khan (@aaliyaanhere) December 3, 2018
The Trailer is full of overacting of @RanveerOfficial.
The only highlight of the Trailer is @ajaydevgn#SimmbaTrailer#RohitShetty â€” shashikant singh (@shashikantsngh) December 3, 2018
Apart from Ajay Devgn there's nothing in #SimmbaTrailer
It leaves you with no impact. This Genre needs dialogue, good action and much more.
It started nicely but ended a dumb squib.
One of the weakest trailers for a big film.
Disappointed. â€” Abhishek Parihar (@BlogDrive) December 3, 2018
For the uninitiated, Simmba is a remake of Telugu movie Temper.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
