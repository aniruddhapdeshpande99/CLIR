I mean, at least, now you know that when Gamora, Vision and Loki died in Avengers: Infinity War, Zoe Saldana, Elizabeth Olsen and Tom Hiddleston were still alive. Because they portray these roles in the cinematic world, and that these characters aren’t real?

Why stating the obvious, you ask? Because some people think that these characters exist in the real world. No, we are not talking about your niece/nephew or the kid that lives next door in his/her bubble. We are talking about grown-ups. For instance, DONALD TRUMP.

Talking about The US President Donald Trump, did you know that he recently brought Google under the scrutiny because when people like you and me searched for &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; on the search engine, his name would pop up.
Why would that happen? Just so unfair, right? Did someone hack Google or what? People had so many questions.
So, undoubtedly, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had to be questioned on that to make sure that &ldquo;it's not some little man sitting behind the curtain figuring out what we're going to show the users.&rdquo;

Read carefully to what he said at the red carpet for the premiere of his upcoming political comedy Vice.
&ldquo;We were filming on Batman in Trump Tower and he said, come on up to the office. I think he thought I was Bruce Wayne because I was dressed as Bruce Wayne. So he talked to me like I was Bruce Wayne and I just went along with it, really. It was quite entertaining,&rdquo; he said.

&ldquo;I had no idea at the time that he would think about running for president,&rdquo; Christian Bale was quoted as saying by Variety.

But aren’t we all living in a world which goes beyond our expectations? I mean, even we didn’t know a Chai Wala would someday become our Prime Minister. Who would have thought that! In life, expect the unexpected. PS - We are sure he doesn't know about Santa Claus as well!
