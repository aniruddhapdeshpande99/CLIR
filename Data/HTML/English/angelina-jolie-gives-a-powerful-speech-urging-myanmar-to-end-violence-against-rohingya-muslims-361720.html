Jolie, a special envoy for the UN's refugee agency, visited sprawling camps in Bangladesh, where she made a speech in defense of 1 million Rohingya refugees.
FYI, more than 700,000 have arrived since August 2017, when Myanmar's army led a violent crackdown following attacks on security posts by a Rohingya insurgent group.
Jolie's visit happened just three days before launching a global appeal for $920 million, chiefly to support the refugees' needs for 2019. She met and talked with refugees, including children and rape victims. Reporters present at the Kutupalong refugee camp quoted her saying,

&quot;It was deeply upsetting to meet the families who have only known persecution and statelessness their whole lives, who speak of being treated like cattle. They have been denied their most basic human right: citizenship in their country of birth. And some still won't even call the Rohingya by their rightful name.&quot;
She went on to thanking Bangladesh for hosting the refugees despite being over populated, and urged the international community to provide more resources for the refugees. Jolie added,

&quot;Bangladesh is a generous country rich in culture and history, but with limited resources. And it cannot be left to shoulder the responsibility of hosting Rohingya refugees alone.&quot;
Jolie said Myanmar must ensure safety for the Rohingya to return home. She added,

&quot;They have an absolute right to return home, but only when they feel safe enough to do so voluntarily and they know that their rights will be respected.&quot;
Bangladesh attempted to start repatriation of Rohingya in November last year, but the country postponed the process after no Rohingya came forward to go back voluntarily.
The UN and other global human rights groups have said no Rohingya should be forced to return. Bangladesh authorities said they will send them back only if they are willing to go back and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged international community to put pressure on Myanmar for ensuring safety in the country for making their voluntary return possible.

Reports claim that most people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar do not accept that the Rohingya Muslims are a native ethnic group. They view them as &quot;Bengalis&quot; who entered from Bangladesh centuries ago. Apart from them being denied of citizenship since 1982, they have a restricted access to education and hospitals.
