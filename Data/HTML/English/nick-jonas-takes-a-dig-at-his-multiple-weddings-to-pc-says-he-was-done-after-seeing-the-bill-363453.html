It was when Host James Corden asked Nick -who had a lie detector on- 'Was there a point during your many weddings that you thought, ''I'm done with these weddings?'''

Well, we are not surprised. Nick and Priyanka tied the knot in December with two weddings and multiple wedding receptions in India and the U.S!
