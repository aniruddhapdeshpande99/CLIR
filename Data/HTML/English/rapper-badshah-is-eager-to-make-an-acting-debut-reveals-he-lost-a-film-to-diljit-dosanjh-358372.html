Indiatimes had a candid conversation with the singer, where we quizzed him if he wants to work in films to which he happily replied,
&ldquo;Of course, I am doing a film, I was offered two films, one I didn’t do and the other one I lost to Diljit Paaji, because he is a better actor. That film was Good News with Akshay Kumar. I am reading scripts and one of it is finalized also, I have a lot of desire to become a hero, do brand endorsements, I want to experience what being a hero feels like.&rdquo;

We also asked the singer if he fears losing his success, his reply won our hearts, &quot;I don’t take this star-tag very seriously. I have just become impatient after achieving success, otherwise, I am still the same. I was patient earlier but now I am not. I have a lot of ambitious, I want to do a lot of things, I am hungry for good work and I feel I have very less time to do so much and things aren’t happening the way i want them to. But I don’t have that air that I am star, sometimes I feel that I should feel like a star and throw tantrums but I genuinely can’t do that. I feel what’s the use of all this, if it won’t benefit anyone.&rdquo;

Badshah even said he will now start doing hardcore rap as he wanted to do it since the beginning but wasn’t able to so because he was building an empire for himself,
&ldquo;I love party music, but I also like hardcore rapping. Somewhere I become greedy because I want to earn money. I have also opened a production house and I need money for that as well. But now I have decided that my next song is going to be very hardcore, if anyone wants to listen they will and others who don't have a taste for such music won't. Touchwood, money is never enough for me and my family. And now I really want to do what I actually want to. Because now I feel if I can take such things to pedestal then why shouldn’t I?&rdquo;.
