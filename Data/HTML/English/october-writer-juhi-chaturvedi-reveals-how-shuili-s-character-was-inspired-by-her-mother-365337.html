&ldquo;I was in Class 2 or 3 when mom had a haemorrhage, she survived that. Then there was kidney faliure and transplant, cancer.... I almost grew up in hospitals and around doctors. It was like hum hi aadhe doctor khud ban gaye the. I was checking blood pressure when I was in class six. I guess if I wasn’t in this profession, I would’ve ended up being a doctor. She passed away after 30 years of suffering, just before Vicky Donor released, but we managed to show it to her at home.&quot;
Juhi and Shoojit Sircar have collaborated for several films including Madras Cafe, Vicky Donor, Piku and October.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
