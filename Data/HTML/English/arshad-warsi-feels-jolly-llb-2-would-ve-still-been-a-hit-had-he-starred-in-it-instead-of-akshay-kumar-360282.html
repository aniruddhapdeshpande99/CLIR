Arshad Warsi Feels Jolly LLB 2 Would’ve Still Been A Hit Had He Starred In It Instead Of Akshay Kumar
Kaun Hain ye log? Kaha se aate hain? – This dialogue from Jolly LLB still tickles our funny bone, doesn’t it? The creative minds on the internet still use this as a meme template.
Arshad Warsi’s Jolly LLB was indeed a great satirical take on the judicial system of India. Who would have thought that this movie, having no (conventional) big star, would win so many accolades including a National Award for the best feature film!

After a grand success, when the makers decided to make a sequel of the movie, they ditched Arshad Warsi and replaced him with Akshay Kumar. Of course, the man was disappointed.
&ldquo;I am not doing it (Jolly LLB 2). Akshay is doing it. I was supposed to do it, but Fox Star Studios needed a bigger star, so they chose Akshay,&rdquo; he had told IANS.

However, when the trailer was released, Arshad Warsi showed a big heart and congratulated the team.
Finally saw the trailer of Jolly LLB2. Love the new Jolly. Looking forward to it, all the best to @humasqureshi @akshaykumar & @subkapoor — Arshad Warsi (@ArshadWarsi) December 20, 2016

Jolly LLB 2 was a blockbuster too. But was that because of Akshay Kumar? Well, Arshad Warsi believes that the movie would have still been a hit, if the makers had roped him in along with Boman Irani.
&ldquo;I think, let's be honest, if Boman and me were there in Jolly LLB 2, it would've still done a 100 crore. And they would've still made more money because they would not be paying us as much as they paid Akshay (laughs). It was a bad move, actually. So, bad move. Actually, Fox (producers) would've made more money with Boman and me (laughs),&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by ZoomTV.

Talking about Jolly LLB 3, he said that it will star both Akshay Kumar and him. &ldquo;That's what I heard. That's what I've been told.&rdquo;
It’s all well that ends well, right? Meanwhile, Arshad Warsi will next be seen in Fraud Saiyaan, which is scheduled to hit the screens on January 18.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
