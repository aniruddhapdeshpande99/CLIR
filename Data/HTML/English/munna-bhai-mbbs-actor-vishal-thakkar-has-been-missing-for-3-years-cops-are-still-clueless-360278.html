The movie was not only a game-changer for debutant director Rajkumar Hirani but also for many others who were a part of the film like Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi - their careers were revived because of this classic movie.
Arshad Warsi has finally confirmed that the third instalment is in the works. The script is ready and the shooting will begin this year, he said, confirming that Sanjay Dutt will definitely be a part of the movie as well.
While the talks of Munna Bhai 3 are on, actor Vishal Thakkar’s intractability is still haunting his family.

Vishal Thakkar’s 60-year-old mother Durga is worried that the case hasn’t progressed even a bit, reports Spotboye.com. There is no hospital record for a man matching his description, and his bank account, too, hasn’t shown any activity since then.
