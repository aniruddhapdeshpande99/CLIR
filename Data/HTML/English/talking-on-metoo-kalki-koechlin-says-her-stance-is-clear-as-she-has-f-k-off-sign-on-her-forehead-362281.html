Admitting that there has been a positive change in the industry, Kalki Koechlin said that there’s a lot of work to be done. When she was asked if she has ever faced harassment in the industry, the Gully Boy actress said that her stance on feminism is quite solid and she hasn’t faced such a situation.
&ldquo;My stance on feminism is quite solid and transparent. I have a big Fuck off sign on my forehead, so no I haven’t faced it. But what I do see is that there is a lot of casual sexism. That happens when someone makes fun of your body. I’ve experienced that. But I’ve been very clear about my stand from the start, so I haven’t had anything dramatic happen to me,&rdquo; she was quoted as saying by India Today.

Earlier in an interview with Cosmopolitan, Kalki had talked about the challenges that women who shared their #MeToo stories had to face.
&ldquo;We can't let fear steer the way, dictate our lives. This movement has proved that we can't sit here and fear what might or might not happen. It's true that women who've been speaking are hugely threatened; their lives are under stress for calling out their abusers,&rdquo; she had said.
