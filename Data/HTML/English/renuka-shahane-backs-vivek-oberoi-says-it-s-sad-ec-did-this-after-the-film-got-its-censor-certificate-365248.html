Nevertheless, Vivek didn’t stop his fight against the criticism he faced, he even picked on the actors for clicking selfies with PM Modi and not supporting him, while talking to Zoom he said, &ldquo;I feel we are not a united industry. I feel when a Padmaavat gets stuck and a legend like Sanjay Bhansali is mistreated and misbehaved with, we should all unite together. I feel if My Name Is Khan gets stuck, we should come together to make sure it doesn't get stuck. It's easy to post selfies with Prime Minister and stuff like that. As an industry, we need to stand together&rdquo;.

Well, now Vivek should take a breather as Swara and Renuka have come out and reacted on the stay of the film. Swara was asked about her opinion on the EC’s ban on the film, she said, &ldquo;Same rules should apply to everyone is my only reaction to anything the EC does or says&rdquo;.

While Renuka wasn’t in support of the film being stalled, she said, &ldquo;I think it's sad that the election commission is taking such a call after the film got its censor certificate. I am sure the makers went through the process and got things in place. They could have asked for the stay if the movie was produced by BJP but it's not. It is made by few individuals who are inspired by an individual who happens to be the Prime Minister of the country&rdquo;.
