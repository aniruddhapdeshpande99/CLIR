That is the song Ranveer Singh was listening to before he flew from India to his wedding destination Italy along with the love of his life Deepika Padukone. And quite evidently, he couldnâ€™t wait to tie the knot to the love of his life!
Beaming with happiness and joy, the couple smiled, waved and thanked the fans who congratulated them saying &ldquo;Shaadi Mubarak&rdquo;. And now itâ€™s almost time to solemnise their six-year-old relationship. They are getting married on the same day when their first movie Ram-Leela had released in 2013 â€“ the same movie on whose sets the couple fell in love with each other.
The wedding celebrations have begun! Singer Harshdeep Kaur and her troup will lend their magical voice to DeepVeer's wedding festivities. Striking a pose outside the Lake Como, she posted a picture all set for a &quot;beautiful day.&quot;
