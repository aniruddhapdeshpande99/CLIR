She wrote:
&quot;Every girl has a certain perception of how they would want their life partner to be... I Honestly Didn’t..
I had this most amazing partner who was my bestest friend, who was the shoulder, I always found when I needed to cry and who made me believe that no matter how tough life is, with us being partners we would take it on,in any form, in any way... That’s the man I eventually married and he never ever stopped being the reason for my smile...
Instagram
So I’m glad I never ever had a perception because the reality of living and breathing this wonderful man is all I ever needed to know.. I Love you @riteishd ..Here’s to many more laughs together, to the zillion times we will wipe each other’s tears and pick each other up when either/or feels weak or simply to life together forever and ever... Happy Anniversary..&quot;
