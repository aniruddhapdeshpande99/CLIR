Sara Ali Khan Aspires To Keep It Real, Says She’s Trying To Be As Organic As She Can
Even before her debut in Sushant Singh starrer Kedarnath, Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Arora’s daughter Sara Ali Khan won hearts of the audiences, after she made her debut on Karan Johar’s chat show Koffee With Karan.
She was confident, smart and refreshingly genuine. She didn’t even hesitate to talk about the fact that she suffers from PCOD (Poly Cystic Ovarian Disorder), a health issue that is very common among young women, in her first appearance on a talk show. She wasn’t even once shy or embarrassed when the video from her childhood was played in which she was apparently over-dramatic. She was like a breath of fresh air.

&ldquo;People appreciate the fact that I am real. I endeavour to be most real person. I don't think too much and try to be as organic as I can. I do make mistakes. With the same token you get appreciation and criticism as well and you have to take it the same way,&rdquo; she said.

Furthermore, she says as a performer, and she wants to experiment.
&ldquo;I am taking each day as it comes. I will see what offers come my way and whatever excites me I will take that up. As an actor I want to experiment with different kinds of films. I have always loved acting. I am always dying to be on a film set. Life is empty for me without that,&rdquo; she said.
