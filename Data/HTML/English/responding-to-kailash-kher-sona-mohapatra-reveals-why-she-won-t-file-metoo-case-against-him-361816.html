It started off a debate on why these women are not reporting the cases and filing FIRs. While some of them like Vinta Nanda, who registered an FIR against Alok Nath, there were others who didn’t take the legal route.
One of them was singer Sona Mohapatra, who had levied sexual harassment charges against Kailash Kher. The singer is quite vocal about her opinions on social media.
Kailash Kher responded to the allegations recently. He said, &ldquo;Everyone has their own thinking. If I accuse someone only by taking that individual's name over and over again then, nothing will come out of it. If you will take legal recourse against that person, then it becomes another matter altogether.&quot;
In response to Kailash Kher, here’s what Sona Mohapatra said:
1)The burdened police would die if every woman who was touched, made a pass at or called up to a mans hotel room despite showing no interest decided to file a complaint.
2) I hope that the other women & minors you have assaulted gather the courage to do so Kailash.@IndiaMeToo https://t.co/x3liRff6TM — SONA (@sonamohapatra) February 8, 2019

Dear India you decide.After close to 9 women speak up publicly about similar perverted behaviour & many more, some minors, share worse horror stories anonymously for fear of shame in society, trouble with parents, Kailash Kher carries on like nothing has happened. Good?Bad?Ugly? https://t.co/J8yR8EAo8o — SONA (@sonamohapatra) February 8, 2019
