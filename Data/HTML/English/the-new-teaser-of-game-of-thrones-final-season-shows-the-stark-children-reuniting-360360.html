There will never be another show that will rule over the world like #GameofThrones did. They had 90% of the population being hysterical over it. So, here‚Äôs to its legacy and an amazing final season, I can‚Äôt wait to see how they will conclude this epic story. #ForTheThrone pic.twitter.com/wf67FasDKS ‚Äî part of the journey is the end (@bcozofdylan) January 14, 2019</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
