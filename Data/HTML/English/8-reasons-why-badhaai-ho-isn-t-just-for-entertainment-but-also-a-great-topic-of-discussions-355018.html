With a smart choice of films and an enviable success rate, Ayushmann has become one of the most bankable actors in Bollywood currently.

When a film engages you with its utter simplicity minus any drama, you know the director has a great approach and sensitive understanding of the medium and the characters. @iAmitRSharma is the real discovery here.@ayushmannk,#NeenaGupta and #SurekhaSikri charm in #BadhaiHo. ‚Äî gayatri gauri (@gayatri_gauri) October 18, 2018
8. The film will definitely start a more mature approach towards couples who conceive at a much later stage in their lives.

A lot of times, it's cinema that manages to bring about a positive change for reasons more than one. Films can manage to strike a sensible conversation around a topic and that might not fizzle out easily. With Badhaai Ho, a conversation around couples who conceive kids at a very late stage in their lives can come to the forefront.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
