What’s even more exciting about this film is the ensemble cast that includes Ranveer Singh, Kareena Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pednekar, Anil Kapoor and Janhvi Kapoor. That’s half of the Bollywood’s most sought-after actors right there.
It’s going to be a period drama. While earlier it was revealed that Anil Kapoor will essay the role of Shah Jahan in the multi-starrer Dharma Productions film, now it has been revealed that Ranveer Singh will play the role of Dara Shikoh and Vicky Kaushal will portray Aurangzeb in Takht, in a recent appearance on journalist Rajeev Masand’s annual actors’ roundtable.
If this was not enough to amp up your excitement level, Karan Johar had earlier said that Takht will be like his iconic film Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, but it will be set in the Mughal era. Well, that sounds exciting, doesn't it?

What is the story about? &ldquo;It’s about two warring brothers and it’s based on facts. It’s like the K3G of the Mughal era. But it’s more extreme, there is more betrayal. It has the tropes of court politics. It’s so rich in texture,&rdquo; Karan Johar had earlier told Film Companion.
