According to an IANS report, Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) general secretary, Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Monday filed a complaint against Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan for allegedly hurting the sentiments of the Sikh community in his upcoming venture Zero.
In a complaint filed at the North Avenue Police Station, Sirsa has said that they have received a number of complaints from the Sikh Sangat. In the complaint, Sirsa alleged that in the promo of the movie, actor Shah Rukh Khan has been shown wearing ‘Gatra Kirpan’ (Article of Sikh Faith) in their movie promo which has created an outrage among Sikh community worldwide.

He also requested the authorities that the promo of the upcoming movie Zero showing actor Shah Rukh Khan wearing Gatra Kirpan, should be stopped without any further delay.
He further said that in the promo, the film star not only appears wearing the Kirpan but also the poster shows the star in a lighter mood thereby further showing the Sikh article of faith in a lighter vein.
