&quot;I never thought about it but it feels great to see such a good response. It is an amazing feeling. It is great that many political leaders have shared and liked the trailer on social media but I have made this film for Indian Army and not for any political party,&quot; Dhar said in a statement.
He added that this is the least &quot;we could do as filmmakers for Indian Army.&quot;
On claims of a lot of Indian fans showing support, he added: &quot;I am glad but I want people to come and watch the film and realise that how much our Indian Army sacrifice.&quot; With much noise soon after the trailer was released, the tension between two rival nations (India and Pakistan) risen.
