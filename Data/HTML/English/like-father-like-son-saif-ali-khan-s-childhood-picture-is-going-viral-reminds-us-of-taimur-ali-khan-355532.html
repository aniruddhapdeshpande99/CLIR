Saif once revealed to the media how he loves spending time with his youngest son,
&ldquo;He has learnt a few new words. He calls me ‘abba’ and has now started to say ‘baby’ and ‘gum’. Whenever he sees a chewing gum, he would just scream ‘gum’. He likes to watch the moon, so I sit with him in my office and show him the moon&rdquo;.
