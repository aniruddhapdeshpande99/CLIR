This fever is spreading like a wildfire and the new member in this josh club is Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
According to a video that has resurfaced online, Nirmala Sitharaman watched Uri with war veterans and even she couldn't stop herself from saying the dialogue aloud.
Twitter
In the video, she is seen saying &ldquo;Howâ€™s the Josh?&rdquo; and to that, there is a quick response by the war veterans who reply &ldquo;High Sir.&rdquo;
After Modi, this is just another instance that proves how the film and the dialogue went on to become a rage! The film has already crossed the 150-crore mark as it continues to run successfully in the theatres.
