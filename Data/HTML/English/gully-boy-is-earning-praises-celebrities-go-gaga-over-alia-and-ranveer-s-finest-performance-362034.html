#Gullyboy is the perfect example of a great Hindi film: It is inevitably a universal blockbuster and will do excellent business in single screens, multiplexes, India and the overseas market.. @RanveerOfficial @aliaa08 @ZoyaAkhtarOff @FarOutAkhtar @ritesh_sid â€” Ramesh Taurani (@RameshTaurani) February 12, 2019
I remember when rap broke out of New York & made it to the Caribbean, my Brooklynn born bros would breakdance on cardboard boxes in Dominican Republic, America had no clue how impactful this platform was going to be for the underdog worldwide.

Few more words on #GullyBoy. @RanveerOfficial finest work yet. Contained yet free, nuanced yet explosive. @aliaa08 A brilliant, achingly true performance, your heart breaks. The rest of the cast were perfectly pitched. Take a bow @jayoza : brilliant camerawork in a complex film. â€” Rahul Bose (@RahulBose1) February 12, 2019</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
