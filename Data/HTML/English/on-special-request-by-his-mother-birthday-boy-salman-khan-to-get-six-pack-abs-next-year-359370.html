Salman Khan even came out to meet and greet the media. The 53-year-old even cut his birthday cake and spoke to the paparazzi for a few minutes.
Asked about his New Year resolution to IANS, he said: &quot;Four days ago, my mother told me that now this four-pack body will not be enough and she asked me ‘what is your resolution for next year' so, I told her ‘nothing' then, she told me ‘you have to achieve six-pack body' so now that means, I have to be disciplined and I am doing that.
