He loves to make films based on politics and the corruption surrounding it. But he begs to differ; the ace filmmaker says he never makes a film on the line of politics or corruption but on the situation and a character which he gets connected to.

In an exclusive conversation with Indiatimes, he said, &ldquo;I don’t make a film on any situation; I find a story in that situation. I don’t think that I am going to make a film on today’s politics. If there will be some story or struggle of any individual and I get connected to it, and if his order character is connected to politics, then I will show that in the film. Otherwise, I don’t make films on politics precisely.&rdquo;

Talking about if corruption is his favorite subject on film making, he said,
&ldquo;There has been corruption in politics every time. Forget today, there was corruption in Mahabharata, which we worship today. There are so many corrupt people in Mahabharata. How women were treated, so, we have been like this always, so I will not make a film on it, I will find a character, like Draupadi or Arjun’s character. I will enhance their characters surrounding the basis of corruption and their journey&rdquo;.

We all know how Prakash Jha was one of the first few directors who started the trend of cop drama with Gangajal. Today every filmmaker is enchasing a similar concept, to which he said, &quot;I only think of a story while making a film and nothing else, that I am going to set a trend with this or that film. I think if my story or the character will be accepted by the audiences or not, will they get engaged with my storytelling, that’s my only focus. I made Jai Gangajal, where there were no issues shown of Bihar, the story was about a land, corporate and colonization issue and the inherent corruption about politics and police.&rdquo;

2018 was a landmark year of films. While the movie featuring Khans flopped, content driven films became instant hits. Prakash Jha has also always focussed on creative topical subjects. Speaking about the same, he said,
&quot;It has to happen, good film and good content have to work, today there is an exhibition possible for small budget films due to multiplexes. Audiences get to choose the film, they read the reviews, watch the trailer and then decide which film to watch, it’s not like Khans films will have to work or won’t work.
If the content of the film is good, it will work otherwise not, it’s that simple and it has been proved time and again. It’s a very good time; we are the creators of content and extremely happy to see this phase.&rdquo; He further added, &ldquo;The film will definitely be still sold on the name of big actors even today but it’s not important the audiences will come and watch it.&rdquo;

Prakash Jha is now coming with a film that is the complete opposite to the genres he's attempted in the past which is - comedy. Yes! The director is producing Fraud Saiyaan featuring Arshad Warsi in the lead.

Talking about producing Fraud Saiyyan, he said, &ldquo;I invested my money in this film because I thought it’s an enjoyable film, When I was reading the script, I was totally engaged, there is no serious subject in it, but I constantly laughed while reading it.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
