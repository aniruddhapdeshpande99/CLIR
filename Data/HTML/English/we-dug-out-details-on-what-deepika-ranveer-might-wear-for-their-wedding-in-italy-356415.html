One of the biggest questions has been: What will Deepika and Ranveer wear? While we were relying on Nitasha Gaurav and Shaleena Nathani (Ranveer and Deepika's stylists) to spill the beans, looks like we at least now know what label the couple will be donning.
A video that is now being circulated on social media gives us a major hint that Deepika and Ranveer might have zeroed down Sabyasachi for their wedding.

A few paper bags in the middle of their luggage and suitcases were spotted, hinting that the couple might have chosen Sabyasachi for the functions in Italy.
Also, considering how Deepika chose Orange Sabyasachi suit for Nandi Pooja in Bangalore, we are not really surprised.
While we will eagerly wait for Ranveer and Deepika's official wedding pictures to melt our hearts in a few days, for now, we can only wish them good luck for the years filled with romance and love that lie ahead of them.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
