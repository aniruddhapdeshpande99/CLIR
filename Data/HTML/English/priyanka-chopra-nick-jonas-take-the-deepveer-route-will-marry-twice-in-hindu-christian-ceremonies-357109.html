Priyanka Chopra-Nick Jonas Take The DeepVeer Route, Will Marry Twice In Hindu & Christian Ceremonies
&ldquo;When are you getting married?&rdquo; – This is perhaps the most annoying question that people get asked in their 20/30s, don’t you agree?
But celebrities, on the other hand, are pitted against this question, perhaps thousands of time. &ldquo;When is Bhai getting married?&rdquo; is a million dollar question, but why do we even care?!
Some things are better left alone to personal discretion – like what you’re wearing on your wedding day and where exactly you are getting married.
But celebrities often find it hard to keep their personal life private. Fame and stardom comes with a downside, after all.
