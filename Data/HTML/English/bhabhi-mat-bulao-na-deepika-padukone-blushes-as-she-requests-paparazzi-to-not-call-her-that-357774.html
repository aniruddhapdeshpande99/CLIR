Adorable together 😍😍😍❤️❤️👌👌💗💘💖 #ranveersingh #deepikapadukone #DeepVeerKiShaadi. Security head Yasin who was once the personal body guard of #shahrukhkhan makes sure the files is clear and even his bodyguards are asked to move out so we get good pics. Thank you as love getting a clean shot like this and we don't like unnecessary people around trying to photo bomb. @viralbhayani
