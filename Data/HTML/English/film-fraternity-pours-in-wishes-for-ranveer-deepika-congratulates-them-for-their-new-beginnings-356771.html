Film Fraternity Pours In Wishes For Ranveer-Deepika, Congratulates Them For New Beginnings!
It was a wedding that will be remembered for years to come. Not because they are two of the most popular Bollywood stars, but because it will remind us of the fact that love triumphs all.
After a rock steady relationship of six years, Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone solemnized their relationship by marrying in Italy's Lake Como.
While the celebrations were spread over three-four days with close family and friends making a cut into the guest list, 14th-15th were the days when the couple started their official journey together by following both Sindhi and Konkani rituals.
The entire country was waiting with baited breaths to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds and after grainy back shots, Ranveer-Deepika obliged us by giving us an opportunity to be a part of their celebrations. While privacy remained one of the key highlights of this destination wedding, both Ranveer-Deepika decided on sharing this private moment by posting pictures on their social media.
The pictures were out by 8 pm on 15th and within seconds the social media platforms exploded with wishes for the couple.
