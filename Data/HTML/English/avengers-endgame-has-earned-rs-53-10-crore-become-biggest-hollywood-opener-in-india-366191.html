&quot;The massive response by audiences across the country is a testimony of how emotionally invested the Marvel fans are in the 'Avengers' franchise. They have eagerly waited to watch the culmination of the journey of 11 years and their extraordinary love for the marvel characters is clearly evident today,&quot; Bikram Duggal, Head - Studio Entertainment, Disney India, said in a statement.
Trade analyst Taran Adarsh said the fourth and final &quot;Avengers&quot; movie is already on the path to creating history.
&quot;'Avengers&quot; Endgame' is sensational...Creates history... Records highest Day 1 of 2019 so far... emerges biggest Hollywood opener to date... Crosses Day 1 business of 'Thugs Of Hindostan', the biggest opener from Hindi film industry (Rs 52.25 crore in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu).&quot;

&quot;'Avengers: Endgame' emerges a game changer... Sets new benchmarks on Day 1... An eye opener for the industry that feels national holidays/festivals yield best results at the box office,&quot; Adarsh added.
He compared the opening day numbers of &quot;Avengers: Infinity War&quot; and &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot;.
&quot;2018: 'Avengers: Infinity War' was Rs 31.30 crore/plus 2000 screens; 2019: 'Avengers: Endgame' Rs 53.10 crore/2845 screens.&quot;
Pointing out a coincidence, he wrote: &quot;'Baahubali 2' released on (Friday) April 28, 2017; 'Avengers: Infinity War' released on (Friday) April 27, 2018; now 'Avengers: Endgame' released on (Friday) April 26, 2019... All three money spinners released on the last Friday of April, and non-holiday releases.&quot;
Trade guru Atul Mohan also posted: &quot;Don't forget it's IPL, election time and non-holiday release! 'Avengers: Endgame' proves that compulsive cinema content can outshine any other event that's happening in India.&quot;
Talking about the good start that &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; has taken, Siddharth Bhardwaj, Chief Marketing Officer, UFO Moviez, said: &quot;Marvel has worked really hard to build each of its superhero franchise fan base. The film is drawing audiences of all these individual superheroes... The record-breaking box office numbers are expected not only from top cities but huge occupancy is being reported from tier I and tier II towns also.&quot;
