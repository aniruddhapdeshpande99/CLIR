Confirming the news to Deccan Chronicle, director Zoya Akhtar said,
&ldquo;My co-writer Reema Kagti and I do feel there’s so much more to be said on the entire hip-hop culture in our country. And another film exploring the theme is being scripted and planned.&rdquo;
When asked about his brother Farhan and whether he will be seen in the Gully Boy sequel, she said,
&ldquo;He just didn’t fit into Gully Boy. And we’re both sorry about it.&rdquo;
She had a legit reason to why Farhan doesn't fit in into the world of Gully Boy. She added,
&ldquo;Also, his image from the Rock On series is affiliated to an entirely different genre of music. It would have been a bit of a culture shock for the audience to suddenly see him swerve from stadium-rock to hip-hop.&rdquo;
Gully Boy did manage to live upto the hype that it created and emerged as a winner at the box-office.
In less than a week of its release, Gully Boy had raked in about 80 crore, as claimed by a report in Box Office India.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
