And now, according to a Mid-Day report, Movie Stunt Artistes Association general secretary, Aejaz Gulab is urging Akshay Kumar again and seeking his assistance to secure insurance for senior stuntmen.
The report quotes Gulab saying,
&quot;Two years ago, getting compensation of Rs 20 lakh for a stuntman's family was impossible. But Akshay sir stepped in and procured accident insurance policies and mediclaim insurance for the 550 stuntmen registered with us. He even pays our premium. Insurance companies only cover those between 18 to 55 years of age. The benefit is not extended to those above the age bracket.&quot;

He further explained that the insurance is more than important for senior stuntmen as over 50 action choreographers are older than 55 years of age. He added,
&quot;If something were to happen to any of them at work, we wouldn't be able to raise enough money via donations to support their families. In most cases, they are the sole breadwinners in the family. It's a double whammy for them â€” while the younger stuntmen are receiving cashless treatment, the senior ones are either letting go of good work since they don't have medical cover or going to work with risk looming large over them.&quot;
He confirmed that he met Akshay Kumar and expressed the issues and is hopeful that Khiladi Kumar will once again come to the rescue of his fellowmen from the industry.
On the professional front, Akshay has his kitty full with some interesting projects that include Mission Mangal, Good News, Housefull 4 and Sooryavanshi.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
