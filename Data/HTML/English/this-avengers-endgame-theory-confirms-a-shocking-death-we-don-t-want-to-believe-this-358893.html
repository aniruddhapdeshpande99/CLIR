The fan theory machine is apparently operating at full speed. The eager fans are leaving no stone unturned.
So, this theory takes us back to Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Remember, in the movie, when Ultron escapes the Stark Tower, Tony Stark tells his team, &ldquo;A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We’re standing 300 feet below it. We’re the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day but that up there, that’s... That’s the endgame. How were you guys planning on beating that.&rdquo; Of course, Tony Stark was referring to Thanos and his army.

The Reddit user feels this conversation is foreshadowing the future? Is it so? We’re sobbing already.
