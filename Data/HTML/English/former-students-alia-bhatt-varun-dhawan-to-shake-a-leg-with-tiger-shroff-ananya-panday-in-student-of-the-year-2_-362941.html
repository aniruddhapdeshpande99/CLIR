A source close to Mumbai Mirror reveals, &ldquo;Farah Khan will be choreographing the song which only features Alia and the film’s team is figuring out ways to incorporate her co-stars from the first film, Varun and Sidharth, in the sequel. Both the actors are expected to shoot their portions in the coming weeks too. Alia and Tiger’s song will be shot over one week on a grand set that is being put up at a suburban studio.&rdquo;

Well, Alia and Varun share a great bond with each other and they look killer together, while Alia is not very comfortable with Siddharth Malhotra due to obvious reasons.

Alia and Sid parted their ways and now the actress is dating Ranbir Kapoor and apparently, Siddharth is in a relationship with the new student Tara Sutaria. We hope they let their bygones be bygones and have a rocking reunion.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
