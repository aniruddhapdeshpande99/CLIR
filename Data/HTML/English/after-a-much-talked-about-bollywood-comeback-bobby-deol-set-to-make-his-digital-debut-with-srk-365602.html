After A Much-Talked About Bollywood Comeback, Bobby Deol Set To Make His Digital Debut With SRK
Bollywood actor Bobby Deol has been in the industry for more than two decades but took a break after his stint in Thank You and Dostana. After almost 6-7 years, Bollywood's godfather Salman Khan revived his career with Race 3 and he couldn't be more thankful.

Yes, as per reports in Pinkvilla, Bobby has signed up for an original film with SRKâ€™s production house Red Chillies Entertainment. This will be the first time we would see the dynamic duo come together to create an interesting project in the digital world.
Produced by Shah Rukh Khan, the film will be one of the anticipated projects to watch out for. Deols and Khans have always maintained friendly relations, so much so, that SRK had even promoted Yamla Pagla Deewana back in 2011.
It will be interesting to see what genre of movie the duo will create. SRK and Bobby Deol will last seen together for Om Shanti Om for their popular title track.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
