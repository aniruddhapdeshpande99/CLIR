Uday Chopra Asks If Weâ€™re Allowed To Be â€˜Atheistsâ€™ In India, Farhan Akhtar Gives An Epic Reply!
Do you believe in God? In a country which is hailed as the land of many religions and languages, is it okay to be an atheist?
Uday Chopra had a similar question recently. To his 1.48 million followers on Twitter, Uday Chopra asked, &ldquo;Are we allowed to be Atheists in India?&rdquo;

And this wasnâ€™t all, Uday Chopra then went on a rant about &ldquo;unproved imaginary beings.&rdquo; In one of his tweets, he wrote, &ldquo;People are fighting over each otherâ€™s unproved imaginary beings and yet thatâ€™s all ok but the moment one says I donâ€™t really believe in an an imaginary unprovable sky daddy, Iâ€™m the weird one.&rdquo;
Hereâ€™s a thought: you can hold a gun to my head a force me to believe in your god. Iâ€™ll even say yes I do...cause letâ€™s face it I want to live, but how do you know what I really believe in my head? I donâ€™t think even your god knows, most likely cause itâ€™s imaginary â€” Uday Chopra (@udaychopra) March 22, 2019

Meanwhile, Uday Chopra had also tweeted about his mental health recently. Last night, taking to Twitter, he wrote, &ldquo;Confession: I am not ok! I am trying but so far Iâ€™m failing. For a few hours, I De-activated my twitter account. It felt as close to death as I could get. Was phenomenal! I think this is a good option for suicide. I might be doing it permanently soon.&rdquo; However, he soon deleted his tweet.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
