Protests in Arunachal Pradesh have turned violent against the government’s move to grant permanent residency certificates (PRCs) to certain categories of people. On Sunday, the protest spilled into the streets as protesters defied curfew and set fire to the private residence of Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein, and ransacked the office of the Deputy Commissioner. Actor Satish Kaushish has apparently also borne heat of the protests as five theatres he is associated with, have been burnt down.
