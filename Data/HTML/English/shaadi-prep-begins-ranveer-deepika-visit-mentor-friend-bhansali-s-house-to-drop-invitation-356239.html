The shaadi-preps have begun in full swing for Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone.
After a Puja in Bangalore at Deepika's house and Haldi-Ceremony at Ranveer's place, the couple has now started dropping in their invitation cards. Today, on the auspicious occasion of Diwali, the couple was spotted visiting their friend and mentor Sanjay Leela Bhansali's abode in Mumbai.
The cupid had stuck for Deepika and Ranveer on the sets of Goliyon Ki Raasleela-Ramleela and that is just one of the reasons why Bhansali holds such a special place in the couple's life.
Ranveer-Deepika went on to do Padmaavat too with Bhansali and all the films have proved to be huge blockbusters. It isn't a surprise that Bhansali is on the guest-list for their two-day functions that are scheduled to happen in Italy.

While Ranveer was spotted in Masaba Gupta's Green Kurta, Deepika was in a casual white shirt. P.S: Deepika's bridal glow on the face is unmissable.
