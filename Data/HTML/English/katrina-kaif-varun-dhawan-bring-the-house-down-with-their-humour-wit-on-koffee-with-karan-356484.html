My equations with Alia is independent. My equation with Ranbir is independent and same with Deepika. I have individual relationships with all. We are not everyday phone conversation buddies, but I like who she (Alia) is. There is a certain enjoyment of each other's company and a certain comfort and fun element that we have when we are together and it was a decision that I made.
