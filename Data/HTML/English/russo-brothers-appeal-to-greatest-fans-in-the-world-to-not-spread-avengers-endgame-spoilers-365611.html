In the letter, the Russo brothers thanked fans for their support for past 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They promised that Endgame, which marks the culmination of the storyline of 22 films, will deliver a &quot;surprising and emotionally powerful conclusion to the Infinity Saga&quot;.

&quot;Because so many of you have invested your time, your hearts, and your souls into these stories, we're once again asking for your help.

Like true fans, stop spreading spoilers, please! Even after you have watched the movie on April 26, don’t ruin it for others.
