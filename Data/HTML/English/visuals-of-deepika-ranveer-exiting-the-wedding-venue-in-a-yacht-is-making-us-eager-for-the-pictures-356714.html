14.11.18 was a special day for Bollywood's most adorable lovebirds. The first day of Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's wedding concluded on Wednesday morning in Italy's Lake Como. The couple tied the knot in a traditional Konkani ceremony in presence of close friends and family members.

While the couple took extra efforts in ensuring the privacy and no official media was cover the wedding, there were few people from the media who were present at the location to at least get some information straight from the wedding.
News agency ANI tweeted special visuals from Deepika and Ranveer's wedding venue Villa del Balbianello.
Even though the video is grainy, you can easily spot ladkiwale and ladkewale and the newly-married couple stepping down from the stairs leading to the boats stationed at the private harbor.
Screengrab
Most of the family members and friends followed the dress-code and donned white and golden outfits but if you carefully look at the video, Deepika can be seen in an orangish/red Saree.
