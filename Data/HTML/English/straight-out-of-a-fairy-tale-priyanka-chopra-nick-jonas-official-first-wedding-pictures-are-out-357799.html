Here's a glimpse from their wedding day!
Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas tied the knot in Christian ceremony on Dec 1, which was followed by Hindu ceremonies on December 2. It is said that Indian food was served for the guests. While for the Christian wedding, it was all about floral decorations, for Hindu wedding ceremony, the theme was all colourful.
The Mandap was reportedly 40 feet high with Mehrangarh Fort as the backdrop. According to DNA, the couple tied the knot at the Baradari Lawns. Congratulations to the gorgeous couple!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
