They are the most looked upto award functions for filmmakers and actors and rightly so. The 91st Academy awards was interesting in a lot of ways. This was the first ceremony in three decades, since the 61st Academy Awards in 1989, to be conducted with no host.
From the moments the nominations were announced in January, this year's awards were poised to be a battle between Bohemian Rhapsody, A Star Is Born and Green Book. In the end, Peter Farelly's Green Book emerged victorious.
Based on the true life, the movie is about a Afro-American pianist who embarks on a concert with Italian-American driver. Taking the award, the cast was speechless and gave the most heartwarming speech.

The awards took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
