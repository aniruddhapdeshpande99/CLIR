When she's not creating wonders on-screen, she is in news for her love life. Kickstarting her Bollywood career with Sidharth Malhotra, Alia gradually fell in love with him and the relationship apparently lasted for 2 years.
But like most of the relationships, the duo called it quits and Alia moved on. From one hottie to another, she is rumoured to be currently dating Ranbir Kapoor. During her earlier interviews, Alia has revealed how she has a major crush on Ranbir and looks like her dream came true.

They two met on the sets of Brahmastra and hit it off instantly. They have been spotted many times during dinners and get togethers. The actress has also been with Ranbir's parents in New York and there were reports that suggested the two might have got engaged.

When a leading publication asked Alia regarding her wedding, this is what she had to say,
&quot;I think people should now take a break. We have had two beautiful weddings last year. I think we can chill now, watch movies, work in movies, and rest can be seen later.&quot;
Well, looks like 2019 will be all about seeing Ranbir and Alia on-screen. But we can't wait to see them tie the knot.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
