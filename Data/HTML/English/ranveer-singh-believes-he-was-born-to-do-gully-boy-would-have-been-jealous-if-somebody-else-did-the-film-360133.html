Ranveer Singh is so good and apt in the role of a street rapper that even before we watch the entire film, we can say that itâ€™s hard to imagine someone else in those shoes, right? Well, Ranveer Singh thinks the same too. He thinks he was born to do Gully Boy, and if somebody else would have done this role, he would have been jealous.

&ldquo;When somebody told me about the script of Gully Boy, I told them that it is my film. If any other actor would have been a part of this film instead of me then I would have got burnt with jealousy. I was born to do Gully Boy and I knew only I can pull off this character,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by IANS.
Ranveer said it is a special film for him for too many reasons. &ldquo;Itâ€™s a coming together of too many things that are very dear to me. It has rap, hip-hop music which I loved since I was a kid and it is set in my motherland Mumbai.&rdquo;
Also starring Alia Bhatt, Kalki Koechlin, Vijay Raaz, Amruta Subhash and Siddhant Chaturvedi in prominent roles, Gully Boy is inspired by the life of Divine and Naezy (Naved Shaikh), underground rappers from Mumbai. Mark the date â€“ the movie is releasing on Feb 14.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
