Despite Bollywood being kind to her, Neena feels the portrayal of women in cinema has not changed at all.
Speaking to IANS, the veteran actress said, &quot;It (portrayal of women in cinema) has not changed at all. It will not change till the time the society changes and it will take time to change the society. The girls are changing quickly but the men are not changing. That is why the girls will go through a very bad time now time now till the next generation comes.&quot;
Neena will next be seen in Parineeti Chopra and Arjun Kapoor's Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar.
