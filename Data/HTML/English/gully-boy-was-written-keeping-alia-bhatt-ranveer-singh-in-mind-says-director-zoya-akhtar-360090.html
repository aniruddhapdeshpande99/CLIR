&quot;I like the genre of music, I like the idea of coming-of-age on a sense and it's an underdog story. It's the story about a boy... so everything attracted me to it, every single thing. And it's a story about my city and Mumbai is a very special place.&quot;
She also mentioned the love that she has for her city, Mumbai. She adds,
&quot;It's one place where I honestly believe that anything can happen. Like you can go this way and be up there and you can go that way and fall down. You can literally feel the heat around the corner and this place is magic. If you sit here and all of it put together, it's just very exciting, I just couldn't resist.&quot;
When she asked what film her film stand out from other films, she added,
&quot;This one is different because it's maybe because of your circumstances may be completely different and your experience in life in terms of the way you navigate it and negotiate it may be completely different. But if you can empathize with a character and if you can emotionally resonate with that character and understand their emotional journey, I think you are home. If you can recognize that in people, I think you can contribute to their story.&quot;
The film also stars Kalki Koechlin and is all set to release on February 14.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
