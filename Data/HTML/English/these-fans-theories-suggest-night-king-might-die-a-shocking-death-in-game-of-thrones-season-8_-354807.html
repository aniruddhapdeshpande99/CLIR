In the last season we saw, Jon and Danny asking for Cersei’s help to kill the army of the dead, but she denies the aliance since Jon decides not to bend the knee. However, after a lot of coaxing and convincing by Tyrion and Jamie, she gives in only to betray them in the end. This has obviously opened the door to a lot of speculative theories. Check out some of the legit ones, right here:
Theory 1
Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) will kill the Night King, think people while discussing it on a Reddit thread.

&ldquo;Throughout the entire series Jaime has been defined by his past; he is the Kingslayer… My prediction is what a better way to redefine yourself and kill the Kingslayer name that has lived with him since he was a boy, than to become the Kingslayer; the Night Kingslayer&rdquo;
Theory 2
Another fan theory says that the dragon fire will be used to break down the iron throne, which is made of Valyrian blade. The swords from the throne will be used to arm thousands of men, who will kill the white walkers.

Well, if that happens, it would be a historic end, right?

Theory 3
Another theory suggests that since the throne has Valyrian blade, Night King will die on its own attempting to sit on the Iron Throne.
