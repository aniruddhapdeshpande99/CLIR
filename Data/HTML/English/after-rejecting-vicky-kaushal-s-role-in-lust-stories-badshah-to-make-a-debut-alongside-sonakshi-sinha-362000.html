Did you know that Badshah was offered films in the past as well! He was offered Vicky Kaushal’s role in Lust Stories. Not just that, he was also offered a role in a Karan Johar film starring Kareena Kapoor Khan and Akshay Kumar. However, things didn’t work out for reasons unknown and the role went into Diljit Dosanjh’s kitty.
&ldquo;Good News'... the one that Diljit Dosanjh is doing with Akshay Kumar, was offered to me. I was offered Vicky Kaushal's role in Lust Stories, which I had declined. I have got other offers too. My focus was on my album,&rdquo; Badshah told IANS.
