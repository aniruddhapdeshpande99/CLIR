Things She Hate About Ranveer Singh To His Best Qualities, Deepika Padukone Gushes About Her Husband-To-Be Over 'Koffee'
It was on the sets of Ram-Leela that Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone fell in love with each other. Their chemistry was so strong and real that they went on to become the most spectacular couple of B-town.
Six years later, they have finally made their relationship official. Confessing that they have been in love since six years and are getting married in on November 14-15, they left fans gushing over their love once again.
But did you know why the wedding date that they have chosen is so special? Because it is the same date on which their first film Ram-Leela had released. November 15 is the day when Ram-Leela, the film that brought these two lovely people together in reel and real life, was released.
While everyone knew that Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone are truly, madly and deeply in love with each other, they were eagerly waiting for them to announce their love for each other officially. Their mushy-gushy comments on each other’s pictures and their lovely chemistry at events was nothing but a proof of 'happily ever after'.
Yesterday, after seeking everyone’s blessings and announcing that they are getting married, Deepika made several revelations about their relationship on Koffee With Karan season 6. Here is everything that she said about Ranveer Singh on the show:
