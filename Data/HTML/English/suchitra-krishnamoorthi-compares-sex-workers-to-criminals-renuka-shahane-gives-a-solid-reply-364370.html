Recently, she was again in the spotlight after she got involved in a friendly banter with actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi on social media.
On Wednesday, Renuka Shahane chose to give her piece of mind on a tweet by Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, wherein she compared sex workers to criminals. In her tweet, Suchitra wrote,
Hidden Compass
&quot;Amma always said, Money is not everything. Even criminals and whores have money. What matters is not money but character and integrity. I truly understand her words only today. Jeez I've never felt more proud of my middle class roots.&quot;
As soon as Renuka Shahane read the tweet, she decided to school Ms Krishnamoorthi. She began the conversation by writing,

&quot;No disrespect to your Amma, but as women let's try and correct the injustice that our traditions have imposed on whores. We castigated whores while letting off their customers who are leading &quot;respectful&quot; lives! Let's not put whores and criminals in one bracket at least.&quot;
In series of posts, she explained her point of view. &quot;Whores sell what is theirs. Criminals take what is others. Whores are often pushed into their profession due to human trafficking at ages as young as 7. Does any child have the right to say &quot;no&quot; at that age? Whores are pushed into prostitution by people they trust explicitly.&quot;
The conversation soon turned into a healthy discussion and it ended on a happy note. Read on!

Whores are abused, raped, tortured, drugged, given hormonal injections at a very early age & then raped relentlessly throughout their professional lives. Most of what should be their earnings is taken away by pimps & middlemen or middle women! 3/4 https://t.co/qQkwPSGztZ â€” Renuka Shahane (@renukash) March 26, 2019
