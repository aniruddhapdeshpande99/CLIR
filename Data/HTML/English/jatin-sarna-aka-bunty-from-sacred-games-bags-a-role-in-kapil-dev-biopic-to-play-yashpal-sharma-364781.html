Yashpal Sharma’s top score of 89 runs in the opening match against West Indies had played a major role in India’s win in the 1983 world cup. Talking about playing the legendary cricketer, here’s what Jatin Sarna said.
&ldquo;Playing Yashpal Sharma was something I never imagined. I was given Madan Lal’s part for an audition but it didn’t work out. Though the audition went fantastic and they liked it too. But Harrdy is playing it now and Yashpal came to me which is eventually more interesting with the fact that most people don’t know his story and journey. Actually, India’s 83 win journey starts from Yashpal’s fantastic knock against West Indies in the very first match which laid the foundation for a bigger win.&rdquo;
