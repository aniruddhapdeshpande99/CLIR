But the biggest cheerleader for her Chhapaak look is Kangana Ranaut’s sister Rangoli. The actress sister shared her review on DP’s look, she wrote, &ldquo;No matter how unfair and unjust the world is we musn’t reflect what we hate, this is commendable on @deepikapadukone and @meghnagulzar part, being an acid attack survivor I pledge to be their biggest cheerleader #Chhapaak&rdquo;.

Kangana's sister and manager, Rangoli is an acid attack survivor and it’s so courageous from her side too that she is living her life like a boss today. Deepika's project has obviously found a special place in every acid survivor attacker’s hearts as they will connect with it. So more power to these survivors. And we just hope the hatred just ends in this world and we all live in peace and harmony.
Coming back to Deepika’s Chhapaak look, she has just left us mesmerized and how. Do post your comments below on how much you liked DP’s this outstanding first look from Chhapaak.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
