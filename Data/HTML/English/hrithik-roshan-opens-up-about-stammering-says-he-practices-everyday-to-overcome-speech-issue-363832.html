During his childhood, Hrithik Roshan was bullied and ridiculed because he stammered. While we assume that star kids often enjoy affluent lives without any hurdles, it is not always true.
For Hrithik Roshan expressing himself through words was a nightmare. His dialogue delivery right now might be packed with punches but earlier in his life, he struggled to even communicate because he would stammer a lot.

He has bravely addressed the issue in the past as well, and he now doesn’t mind talking about it in order to inspire those who go through the same. He once said that Aamir Khan’s Taare Zameen Par is one movie which is very close to his heart. &ldquo;This was one film that has just stayed with me,&rdquo; he had said.

He wanted to be an actor but he could only fulfill his dreams by overcoming his fears. He underwent speech therapy. He is now a successful movie star, but he says he practices speech every day.
&ldquo;I’d practice every day to overcome the speech issue, I still do for an hour at least so that I can control the secondary actions like twitching and all. The unacceptability to stammering was not only bothersome in my childhood but also prevailed till 2012, long after I had become a film star,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by Deccan Chronicle.
Hrithik Roshan also admitted that he had to let go of a lot of film offers because he wasn’t confident about carrying off long monologues.
&ldquo;I have now accepted myself as a slow speaker, I have to go through the sentences for a fraction of a second in my mind before saying them aloud. For a long period, it was a struggle for me to accept this, but now I am fine with it,&rdquo; he said.
