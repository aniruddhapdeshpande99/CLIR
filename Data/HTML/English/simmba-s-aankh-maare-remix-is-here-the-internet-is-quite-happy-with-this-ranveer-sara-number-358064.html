Simmba's Aankh Maare Remix Is Here & The Internet Is Quite Happy With This Ranveer-Sara Number
Bollywood has come to a full circle. After making some original master pieces back in 90s, 2018 has been only about remixing them. From the sizzling Dilbar to the party number Urvasi, remixes have become a fad again.
Twitter
And one such song that is making its way back in the market is 'Aankh Maare'. The original song featured Arshad Warsi in Tere Mere Sapne was quite a hit and looks like the brand new remix will just double its popularity. In fact, it already has.
Take a look.
The song stars Ranveer Singh and Sara Ali Khan with a teensy cameo from Karan Johar. Sara's second film Simmba which is all set to release next week is nothing like her first.

This one is a typical Rohit Shetty film with lots of action, party tracks and drama. In the song, Ranveer and Sara can be seen twinning in black. The highlight of the song are the Golmaal boys who give a pleasant surprise in the end. Yes, which also means Arshad who was in the original one as well. Check out the internet reactions.
