Doordarshan To Bring Its Iconic Shows On A Streaming Platform & We Can't Wait To Relive The 90s
Indian audiences were tired of the same-old Saas-Bahu serials when Over-the-top (OTT) content players came into the market and established themselves so well that they are only going forward from here on. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar and AltBalaji among others have gained huge popularity in India.
Remember the nation went into a frenzy after Sacred Games and Mirzapur had released. Nawazuddin Siddiqui said that people in Italy would also recognise him as Ganesh Gaitonde.

What all shows will be available on this platform? Well, that hasn’t been decided as of yet.
&ldquo;We have a huge library of content. Some of our content is iconic. People of India associate themselves with our shows as they have grown up watching such shows. So we are trying to see if that kind of platform can be developed for us to utilise it,&rdquo; she added.
