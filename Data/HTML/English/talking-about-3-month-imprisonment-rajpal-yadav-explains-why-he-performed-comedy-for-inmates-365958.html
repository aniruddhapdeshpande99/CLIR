Yadav, who is of the view that bygones should be bygones, also explained that he made sure to live a disciplined life. He was quoted saying,
&ldquo;If people there think that this is the end of life, I thought I should use my creativity to make them feel alive... I understood that if I have to live here, I have to indulge in creative things that benefit me and them equally. Koshish karta rehta tha ki logo ko acha lage, ek doosre se seekhe aur samjhe... I used to pariticpate in several cultural programmes. Museebato ko toh mai kisi ki kam nahi kar sakta, kam se kam unka blood circulation hi acha rahe, taaki wo ache se rahe.&quot;
