&ldquo;I think he wanted to try his hand at different space and milieu. We should give it to him for that. We have become ruthless and sometimes hypocrites also. Just a few days ago, I was saying that ‘I know I have been doing the same kind of characters, getting a tag of being the hero’s friend. Now, if somebody else has tried something, why are we after his life&rdquo;.
The actor admitted that Zero isn’t a great film, but we all should give a little time to it,
&ldquo;I am not saying that Zero is a great film. I think everybody has the right to say that they didn’t like the film and there are problems. All of us know where the film lacks, but I think it’s getting mixed (reactions). Some people are really loving it and some people can’t sit through the entire film&rdquo;.

Stating Zero is a different film, he says, &ldquo;We have never attempted this kind of a film in India. Maybe the story… we have heard it so many times. There is nothing new in the story as such, but the placement…they wanted to try something,&rdquo;
Zeeshan who is being seen in big budgets film lately is planning to take a break from it, here’s why, &ldquo; I will avoid very big budget films for some time. The problem is that you don’t have anything at stake when you do these kinds of films because most of the critics just talk about the so-called ‘A-listers’. So, you don’t get to know about your performance from critics and not too much from the audience&rdquo;.
Zeeshan will be next seen in Kangana Ranaut’s Manikarnika.
