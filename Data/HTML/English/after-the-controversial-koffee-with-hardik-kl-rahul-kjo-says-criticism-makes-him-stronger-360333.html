After The Controversial 'Koffee' With Hardik-KL Rahul, KJo Says Criticism Makes Him Stronger
For celebrities, social media is both boon and bane and they struggle to strike a balance every single day.
For Karan Johar, his last episode of Koffee With Karan proved out to be a big disaster as the episode ran into multiple controversies after KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya's misogynist comments received backlash.
While the two cricketers landed into a lot of troubles for their comments, KJo also had to face a lot of flak for his show Koffee With Karan.

KJo confessed that he indeed reads up everything being written about him on social media, and says he finds strength from the praise and the criticism.

&quot;All the praise, all the criticism somewhere makes you stronger. I read a lot of criticism and wake up to abuse sometimes and wake up to the nasty things they write about you but some of the things they write are actually true,&quot; Karan said.
&quot;When they criticize you, they are coming from some place of information that you must have also about yourself. Hence, it's important to read the good and the bad and sometimes just turn your face from the ugly,&quot; he added.
KJo expressed his way of handling social media while talking to actor Shahid Kapoor and his brother Ishaan Khattar during an episode of Koffee with Karan season 6, read a statement.
Shahid also gave his two cents on handling the negativity on social media. He was quoted as saying,

&quot;I actually don't find it pressure at all, I have made peace with it. I give it as much importance as it is necessary.&quot;
But Shahid said he doesn't pay attention to damaging comments because that way it ends up messing with their head.
