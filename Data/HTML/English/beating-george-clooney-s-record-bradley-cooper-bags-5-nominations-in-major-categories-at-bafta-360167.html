Despite five nominations at the Golden Globe, Bradley Cooper's directorial debut only took home one trophy for Best Original Song for Shallow, which was written by Lady Gaga and Mark Ronson. Fans were left disappointed, of course.

However, now all eyes are glued to the BAFTA Awards, where A Star Is Born has been nominated under seven categories. What’s worth noting down here is that five out of these seven nominations are in the name of Bradley Cooper for best film, actor, best director, adapted screenplay and original music. And this has never happened before.
&ldquo;What we think is a first is that Bradley Cooper has been nominated for producer, director, writer, actor and composer,&rdquo; Emma Baehr, BAFTA's director of awards and memberships said.
