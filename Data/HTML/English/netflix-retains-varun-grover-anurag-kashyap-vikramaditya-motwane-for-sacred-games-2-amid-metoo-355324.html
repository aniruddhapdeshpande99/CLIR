On the other hand, Varun Grover was accused of sexually harassing an anonymous woman. Amid the #MeToo movement and claims, rumours were doing the rounds that some of the core team members of Sacred Games 2 will be sacked by Netflix.

The production house was dissolved last month after allegations resurfaced against Bahl in the wake of #MeToo movement in India. The case dates back to an incident that took place in Goa in 2015.
Whereas, Grover was anonymously accused of sexual harassment, a claim he has categorically denied. In multiple statements, he has said that while he supports the movement, he wants to clear his name for his mental health. There has been no response from the anonymous account after he asked for closure.
