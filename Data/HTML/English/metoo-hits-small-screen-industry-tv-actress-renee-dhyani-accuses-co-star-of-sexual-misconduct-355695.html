&ldquo;We all got drunk and were dancing. This guy [a leading male TV actor whose name Renee does not wish to disclose in print] was so high, he started posing and yelling in front of my face saying 'choos choos' (suck). For one second, I was like 'what the h**l he is doing, pointing at his crotch'. The director of the show said 'Renee don't react'. I said I will not leave him like this. How dare he say a word like this in front of his girlfriend. Even his bhabhi (sister-in-law) was present. Everybody asked me to shut up. I was so hyper, and told him, 'Ask your girlfriend (to do this)',&quot; she told Hindustan Times.
