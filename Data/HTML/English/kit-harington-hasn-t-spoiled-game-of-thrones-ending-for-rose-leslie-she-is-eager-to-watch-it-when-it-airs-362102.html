&ldquo;I genuinely don’t know the ending (of the show). He told me the ending of last season and I remember getting a bit uppity about that… So he told me about the dragon and I got rather livid with him, because I said, ‘You weren’t supposed to tell me everything! And that’s a huge piece of information!’ And he’s like, ‘Well, you asked!’ And I was like, ‘I know’,&rdquo; she told Entertainment Weekly in an interview.
She regrets not framing the question better back then.
&ldquo;I was like, ‘Tell me some things, but don’t tell me other things.’ But I actually don’t know the ending (to the show) because, believe it or not, it’s such a monumental phenomenal show, and I want to be like the rest of the world and watch it in real time and get that build up and anticipation. I want to finally come to the final episode and truly and I honestly mean this truly not know which way it goes,&rdquo; she added.
April 14 – mark the date – that’s when Game of Thrones season 8 will air.
