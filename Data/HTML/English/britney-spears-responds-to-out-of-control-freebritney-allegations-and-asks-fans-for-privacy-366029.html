The protest was live-streamed on YouTube, with attendees shouting, &quot;Hey, ho, Larry Rudolph has got to go,&quot; claiming it was her longtime manager's decision to put the star in the facility. The protesters were also seen holding signs that read &quot;Free Britney&quot; and &quot;Truth Will Set Her Free&quot;.
On Wednesday, Spears released a video on Instagram in which she said she and her family needed some time off &quot;to heal&quot;.
&quot;Hi guys, just checking in with all of you who are concerned about me. All is well. My family has been going through a lot of stress and anxiety lately, so I just needed time to deal. But don't worry, I'll be back very soon,&quot; she said in a short selfie video.

The clip was accompanied by a lengthy caption breaking down the speculation and shutting down rumours.
&quot;I wanted to say hi, because things that are being said have just gotten out of control! Wow! There's rumors, death threats to my family and my team, and just so many things crazy things being said. I am trying to take a moment for myself, but everything that's happening is just making it harder for me. Don't believe everything you read and hear. These fake emails everywhere were crafted by Sam Lutfi (producer) years ago... I did not write them.
&quot;He was pretending to be me and communicating with my team with a fake email address. My situation is unique, but I promise I'm doing what's best at this moment. You may not know this about me, but I am strong, and stand up for what I want! Your love and dedication is amazing, but what I need right now is a little bit of privacy to deal with all the hard things that life is throwing my way. If you could do that, I would be forever grateful. Love you (sic),&quot; Spears wrote.
