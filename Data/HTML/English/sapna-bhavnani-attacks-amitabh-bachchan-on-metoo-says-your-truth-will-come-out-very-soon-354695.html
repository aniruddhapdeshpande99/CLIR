Sir, the film Pink has released and gone and your image of being an activist will soon too. Your truth will come out very soon. Hope you are biting your hands cuz nails will not be enough. @SrBachchan #Metoo #MeTooIndia #comeoutwomen.&quot;

Wohi to. Koi bhaav nahin deta to nirdosh ka naam chillati hain publicity keliye aisi aurate. Aur jo sach mein bhugat rahi hain, un pe kiye huwe atyachaar ka mazaak banaaya jaata hain. #WhyNotMe — Dharmesh Patel (@mrdkpatel) October 12, 2018
If you ain’t naming the crime YOU HAVE NO RIGHT to drag someone’s name into the mud! Me too is a serious movement and NOT for ppl with other agenda to use it and trivialise it — tina noor (@sealed_beauty) October 12, 2018
He has die hard fans .. you won’t be able to get away if this so easily . But bye the way who are you : how come Me Bachchan comes in contact with such people. I don’t think he even gives too hoots to such kind of people. — Sharad Kumar Singh (@singhsharadkgma) October 12, 2018
