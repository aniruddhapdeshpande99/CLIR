No one still knows what exactly happened on the flight that led to the downfall of Indiaâ€™s most popular comedian Kapil Sharma, but all people are hoping is to see them both come together.

For long, Kapil Sharma was missing from the limelight. Rumours suggested that he has been in a rehab in Delhi and now he has stopped drinking. He came back to Mumbai and got married to his long-time girlfriend Ginni Chatrath.
And heâ€™ll soon be back with his new show with Salman Khan and Ranveer Singh.

Super cheap version of Comedy Nights being tried but #KanpurWaleKhuranas get a band of rejected actor's n try replacing the top show, pl think again, Comedy n cheapness r 2 different things @WhoSunilGrover @KapilSharmaK9 , best u are with eachother, baaki aap bade log â€” Ashish Bajpai Indian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (@er_ashishbajpai) December 15, 2018
#KanpurWaleKhuranas As expected it is very difficult for @WhoSunilGrover to run a show alone. First 30min full over acting and poor jokes. Only @RanveerOfficial can make people laugh and not the #khuranas tonight.
Besides, unsuccessful attempt to copy #TKKS . â€” Lal Saurabh Vikram S (@lal_saurabh) December 15, 2018
#KanpurWaleKhuranas first of all time is clashing with #BigBoss12 and #IGT8 and second its good in parts only and @RanveerOfficial only saved the show. @WhoSunilGrover you were much bettet as gulati and rinku bhabhi, but sry sir khurana nahi jame hume. â€” Amit thakur (@Amtthakur) December 16, 2018

@WhoSunilGrover its time for you to make people &quot;laugh&quot; - NOT RUN AWAY FROM TV. Such low format dialogues with high expectations made me really disappointed this weekend. #kanpurwalekhuranas (extreme bakwas) â€” Akrishma Chatterjee (@AkrishmaJi) December 16, 2018
