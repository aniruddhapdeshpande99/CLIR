For a country who lives and feeds on cricket, the Shah Rukh Khan starrer was a stark reminder of the feeling of belongingness for national sports in the heart of every Indian. Not only did the movie ignite patriotism, but the compelling plot of the movie gave women sports players an apt depiction on the silver screen.

&ldquo;Sattar(70) Minute, sattar min hai tumhare paas. Shayad yeh.. tumhare zindagi ke sab se khaas sattar minute hai. Aaj tum achha khelo ya bura khelo, yeh sattar minute tumhe zindagi bhar yaad rahenge…&rdquo;
When Shah Rukh Khan had mouthed this very dialogue in the movie, it had sent chills down the spines of every viewer. And yesterday, when Shah Rukh Khan was at the Hockey World Cup 2018’s opening ceremony at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, he charmed the audiences again with his goosebumps-inducing speech.

&ldquo;This is the most important tournament of the world. Because it is our sport, it is our hockey and there is no more special game than field hockey. And what sets it apart is that it is an amalgamation of a lot of emotions, thought and lots and lots of action. It involves guile, strength and stamina. It is a sport that involves artistry. Players are not mere players, they are artists,&rdquo; he said.
Be it off-screen or on-screen, Shah Rukh Khan and his charming personality leaves us all in awe of him, don’t you agree?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
