Considering their private life is always under the scanner and in public eye, they are scrutinised very closely.
However, Tahira Kashyap chose to make an exception. In a recent candid interview, Tahira Kashyap spilled the beans on how her marriage with Ayushmann Khurrana had hit a rough patch during his debut. Khurrana made his debut in 2012 with Vicky Donor and the movie went on to become a blockbuster.
However, what we didn't know about that time was how he and wife Tahira were struggling with insecurities and other issues. Tahira confessed that as a wife, she wasn't very accepting about his love-making scenes with Yami Gautam in his debut film Vicky Donor (2012). In a recent interview with Anupama Chopra for Film Companion, author-turned-filmmaker opened up about the rough patch and said,
&ldquo;I was this crazy, insecure pregnant person when Vicky Donor happened and that was the worst phase for the both of us. I think both of us were very immature. I’m sure he didn’t have the maturity to kind of hold my hand and tell me it’s okay, especially, when I am crazy or my hormones because I was pregnant at the time and I also didn’t have the maturity to just take it easy and say that this thing will get over.&rdquo;
She added how insecurities a wife took over her marriage and she was constantly in a zone of self-doubt. She added,

&ldquo;Both of us lacked maturity at that point of time and you also feel like a whale and considering your husband is with beautiful women all around and you don’t come from that background, you even have the maturity you have that passion towards the fact that you understand art, but you don’t have the maturity to kind of deal with the frills that come along.&quot;
She added that it was the foundation of their relationship and marriage that helped them sail through the troubled waters. She says,
&ldquo;I was very lost and so was he, honestly speaking, but thankfully for us knowing each other for the past nine ten years before marriage really helped because I know that he’s not a bad guy and he knows that she’s not a bad girl, so I think that kind of sustained and they we kind of made peace with it.&quot;
Cut to 2019. With back to back hits, Khurrana has become one of the most bankable stars. On the other hand, Tahira is battling with cancer and getting all prepped up for the big directorial debut for which she will start shooting in March this year.
