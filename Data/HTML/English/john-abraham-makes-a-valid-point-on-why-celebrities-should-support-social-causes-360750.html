Twitter
&quot;It's very good. As a film industry person, I feel that it's great that more people are coming forward with various social causes. I think if you are in position and you have a platform, then you must do it.&quot;

Don't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES
&quot;It's really nice to see that many people are working towards social causes because it's not just a good thing for our country but for the entire world.&quot;
John was spotted sporting a moustache for his upcoming film &quot;Batla House&quot;. Talking about the same, he added,
&quot;I have not completed shooting of the film. We are finishing one big schedule. Nowadays, everybody gets scared of me because I look like a cop.&quot;
