Also, he is one of the top 10 newsmakers of the year, according to Yahoo, competing against PM Modi who topped the list. And if you didn’t know it already, his nanny’s salary is more than that of the prime minister of the nation. He is two-years-old but he is a big star already.
We know it’s highly arguable if he became popular because of media or did the media followed his popularity, but what we know is that the little munchkin’s stardom is going out of control.
For those of you who don’t know, there’s his look-alike doll that is being sold online. Cute or creepy, we leave it on you to decide.
