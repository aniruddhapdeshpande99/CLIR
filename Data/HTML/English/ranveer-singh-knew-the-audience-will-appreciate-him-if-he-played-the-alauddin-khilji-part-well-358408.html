&quot;I trusted the audience, I trusted their maturity and the fact that they have evolved over time that they can see the performance for what it is. I felt that if I do this part well, they will appreciate me as an actor. I'm glad I trusted the audience and my trust in them paid off. It was a huge risk, but I'm never one to play it safe. So I'm glad I took the risk,&quot; he concluded.
