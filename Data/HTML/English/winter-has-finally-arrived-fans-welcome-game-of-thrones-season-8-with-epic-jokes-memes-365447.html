Winter Has Finally Arrived! Fans Welcome Game Of Thrones Season 8 With Epic Jokes & Memes
After what felt like eternity -- 595 Days to be precise, winter has finally arrived. One billion people tuned into HBO to watch the first episode of Game Of Thrones season 8. All the fans across the globe, including Indians who watched it on Hotstar, forgot their Monday blue and woke up at 6:30 am eager to watch the finale season, and boy, it was one heck of an episode, tbh.
With so many wow moments and so many twists, in just about an hour, episode one of Game Of Thrones season eight hooked the entire world. It has set the stage for a wild ride to finale. It is the beginning of THE end.
(Warning: The following contains spoilers for the Season 8. If you haven’t watched the first episode of season 1, don’t scroll down.)
From Stark sibling reunion to Jaime Lannister arriving at Winterfell, from Jon Snow finding out who he really is to his romance with Daenerys Targaryen, it was an overloaded of emotional high and lows.

Sansa, throwing shade at Khaleesi:
&quot;What do dragons eat anyway?&quot;
Khaleesi, breaker of chains, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Sipper of Tea, and Blocker of Shade:
&quot;Whatever they want.&quot;
ADVANTAGE: Khaleesi. #GameOfThrones pic.twitter.com/a0O8FsX3aD — BrooklynDad_Defiant! (@mmpadellan) April 15, 2019
