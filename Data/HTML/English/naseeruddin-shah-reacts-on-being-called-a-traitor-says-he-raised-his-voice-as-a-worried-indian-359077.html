Naseeruddin Shah Reacts On Being Called A Traitor, Says He Raised His Voice As A Worried Indian
Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah doesn't believe in mincing his words and this is the main reason why he ends up receiving a lot of flak.
Recently, he landed himself at the center of a major controversy over his remarks on the spate of mob lynching cases in the country following the killing of a policeman in Bulandshahr earlier this month.

He said the death of a cow was being given importance over killing of a policeman. Wondering why his comments on mob violence were being misconstrued with some people calling him a &quot;traitor&quot;, actor Naseeruddin Shah said on Friday that he spoke as a &quot;worried Indian&quot; and has the right to express concerns about the country he loves.

&quot;What I said earlier was as a worried Indian. I have said this earlier as well. What did I say this time that I am being called a traitor? It is very strange,&quot; Shah told reporters here at his alma mater, St Anselm's Senior Secondary School.
Raising his voice against the criticism he received, he asked,
Naseeruddin Shah: What I said earlier was as a worried Indian. What did I say this time that I am being termed as a traitor? I am expressing concerns about the country I love, the country that is my home. How is that a crime? pic.twitter.com/XcQOwmzJSh — ANI (@ANI) December 21, 2018
&quot;I have to bear criticism. If they have the right to criticise, then I also have the same right. I am expressing concerns about the country I love, the country that is my home. How is that a crime?&quot;
Shah was responding to a question about the backlash he is receiving on social media following his remarks. The 68-year-old actor had expressed anxiety over the growing mob violence in a video interview with Karwan-e-Mohabbat India, which the organization shared on its YouTube channel on Monday. In the interview, the actor expressed concern over the well-being of his children, who he said have not been brought up as followers of any particular religion.
The internet was clearly divided.
Those who constantly chant &quot;Hindu khatre mein hai&quot;, are terming Naseeruddin Shah as a traitor for saying &quot;he's afraid for his children&quot;. Apparently, only one group of people has the right to be concerned for themselves, baki sab anti-national. — Pratik Sinha (@free_thinker) December 21, 2018
Naseeruddin Shah is right. There is indeed an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and intimidation... for traitors in today’s India. This is new India. It no more entertains parasites who made their whole career here but feel more safe and loved in the enemy’s territory. — Sonam Mahajan (@AsYouNotWish) December 21, 2018
Naseeruddin Shah has been doing full-on identity politics himself, but when the other side gets down to identity politics, he smells fear and intolerance.
He doesn’t think twice before tainting his own nation which has loved him so much, given him so much fame — Abhijit Majumder (@abhijitmajumder) December 21, 2018
News of no importance : 52 tribals enslaved for 3 years in Karnataka.
News of regional importance : 251 farmers suicides in Karnataka.
News of national importance : Taapsee Pannu ne troll pel diya.
News of international importance : Naseeruddin Shah ko darr lag raha hai. — THE SKIN DOCTOR (@theskindoctor13) December 21, 2018
Naseeruddin Shah by speaking the truth has performed his duty to the nation. Our constitution, our ethos, our culture, our way of life are under attack.We will standup & protect it. Those who have a problem with this can go anywhere they like. India belongs to all of us. Period — shahid siddiqui (@shahid_siddiqui) December 21, 2018
&quot;Tomorrow if a mob surrounds my children and asks them: 'Are you Hindu or Muslim?' they will have no answer. Because they have no religion.&quot; Don't see anything wrong in what Naseeruddin Shah is saying. As a father, he can't be afraid for his children? — PDG (@PratimDGupta) December 21, 2018
Naseeruddin Shah's fear as minority in India were misplaced as the ruling party had to deploy entire It cell and media channels to discredit him. It is the govt which is in fear. — Happucrat (@AreeDada__) December 21, 2018

Shah said the &quot;poison has already spread&quot; and it will be now difficult to contain it.
&quot;It will be very difficult to capture this djinn back into the bottle again. There is complete impunity for those who take law into their own hands. In many areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow is more significance than that of a police officer,&quot; he added.
For the uninitiated, on December 3, Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh and a student, Sumit Kumar, were killed in mob violence in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr district after cow carcasses were found strewn around.
The main accused in the case is a local Bajrang Dal leader, Yogesh Raj.
