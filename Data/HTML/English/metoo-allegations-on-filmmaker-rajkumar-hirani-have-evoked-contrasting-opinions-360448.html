A few people are defending the filmmaker and others are still silent.
&quot;Raj Kumar Hirani is too good a man to do something like this,&quot; said Indian film producer Boney Kapoor while reacting on recent sexual harassment allegations leveled against the Bollywood director.
Twitter
&quot;I don't believe this allegation. He can never do something like this,&quot; Kapoor asserted.
Just to join the dots for you, a HuffPost India article reported that a woman (Who was assisting Hirani on Sanju) said that on April 9, 2018, the director first passed a sexually suggestive remark to her and later sexually assaulted her at his home office.

&quot;I don't want to comment on this. It's just an allegation. Nothing has been proved as of yet. The director has already dismissed the allegations. Till the time something is not proven, I don't think it right to comment on this,&quot; Hashmi said.
While a few of the Bollywood actors who have worked with Hirani have expressed their opinion, a few others are still waiting for the impending legal procedure to prove something.
