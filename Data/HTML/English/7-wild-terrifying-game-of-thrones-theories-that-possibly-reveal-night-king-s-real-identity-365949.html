In the last episode of season 8, we saw all the main characters preparing for the battle with the army of dead, which arrived just in time. This was perhaps the last episode where we saw all of them alive and together. The biggest and the most powerful villain in season 7, the enigmatic Night King now has a white dragon too. But who is Night King?

He is one of the main characters in the show right now. But we still don’t know much about him.
Who is the Night King?
All we know right now is that he was once a human and was turned into the Night King, thousands of years ago, by the Children of Forest, so that he could be used as a weapon against humans. But when the Children of Forest lost control over white walkers, a race of human converted into ice creatures by Night King, they joined hands with humans to fight against him.

Fans have been speculating as to who he could be. After all, Game Of Thrones is the show that breeds fan theories like none in the history. So, here’s what the fans think!
#1 Bran is the Night King.
And he is the one who built the wall.
Bran is the three-eyed Raven who can travel into the past through warging (entering the mind of people). Remember when he got back in time, into Hodor's brain? There might be another accident that causes him to trap himself. When he goes back in time and witnesses the war between First Men and Children Of The Forest, he sees First Man was tied to the tree, and there, he gets stuck, and is turned into the Night King by Children of Forest.
So, after all these years he wants to return and that is perhaps the reason why the Night King is looking for Bran.
#2 Night King is a Targaryen.
Firstly, he can ride a dragon. Going by the history of the show, only Targaryens can ride dragons, just like how Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow did.
Plus, remember 10-year-old Ned Umber was killed in the first episode of GoT S8 by the White Walkers, and when Tormund discovered his body, he was surrounded by body parts in spiral shape. What does that symbol mean? Looks like there’s a connection with Targaryens.
#3 Night King is the song of Ice and Fire!
And everyone else is just dancing to his tunes.
According to this theory, Night King is the three-eyed-raven who can see the past, present as well as the future. After the wall was built and white walkers were sent on the other side, he saw the future including the fight of the frozen lake. He knew who all will take a part in it, and so he influenced them directly and indirectly and acquired the dragon. He is powerful because he knows the future.
#4 Night King is a Stark ancestor.
And that is why he seems connected to Starks, particularly Bran.

It is known that Starks are the descendants of the First Men who were engaged in battle with the Children of Forest. Their history is tied to the North. And perhaps, this is the reason why Bran and Jon in particular are drawn in the battle against the White Walkers. Was Night King a Stark when he was human?
Also, according to the book, in which Night King is a slightly different character, he is a rumored ancestor of the Stark family, who falls in love with a White Walker and marries her later declaring himself as the Night King.
#5 Night King was once the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch

Again, this theory has association with the books. In the books, Night King was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and a stark. Also, if you see his armour closely, it has a brooch, which looks like a skull of a crow or a raven.
#6 Jon Snow Is the Night King
In the books, Night King is more of a myth like Azor Ahai. And so, some fans think he will be reborn, this time as Jon Snow.

According to this theory, to kill the Night King, someone has to pull out the dragon glass from his chest, which was used to create him. It is only then he will die, unlike other white walkers which can be killed by any dragon glass. So, when Night King dies, the other white walkers lose their mind and start doing whatever they want to, because they don’t have a leader who is controlling their mind. Hence, to bring the situation in control, Jon Snow, being the selfless man that he is will stab himself with the same dragon glass and become the new Night King. So, Night King is immortal.
#7 Night King is the God of Death.
via GIPHY
According to this theory, Night King identity as a former human being will never come into play. He is just the God of death, the destructor and the ultimate evil. He is not a human anymore, and hence, he doesn’t have a choice. Adding to this, he can’t even speak. He doesn’t have any dialogues. He is the God of death.
