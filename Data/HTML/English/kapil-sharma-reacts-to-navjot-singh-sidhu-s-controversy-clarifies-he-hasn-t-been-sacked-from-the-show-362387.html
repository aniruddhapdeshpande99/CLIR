After Navjot Singh Sidhu’s controversial remark on the terrorist attack, hashtags #BoycottSidhu, #BoycottKapilSharmaShow and #BoycottSonyTV were trending on Twitter.
&ldquo;For a handful of people, can you blame the entire nation and can you blame an individual?,&rdquo; Sidhu had said earlier adding, &ldquo;It (the attack) is a cowardly act and I condemn it firmly. Violence is always condemnable and those who did it must be punished.&rdquo;

&ldquo;There should be a permanent solution to this problem. If sacking Sidhu Ji was a solution, then Sidhu Ji is smart enough to walk out of the show himself. So, people are being misled with hashtags like ‘#BoycottSidhu’ and ‘#BoycottKapilSharmaShow’. Right now one should focus on the genuine problem and the attention of the youth should not be taken away from the real issue,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It’s all propaganda that keeps on running on Twitter and I don’t get involved in such things. I have started doing some good things and I want all of you to support me in this instead of creating controversies around my comments.&rdquo; He added that Archana Puran Singh shot a few episodes with the team of his show because Sidhu Ji had some prior commitments.
