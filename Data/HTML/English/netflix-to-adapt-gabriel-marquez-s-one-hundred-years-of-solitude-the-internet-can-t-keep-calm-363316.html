Netflix To Adapt Gabriel Marquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' & The Internet Can't Keep Calm!
The absolute masterpiece ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' novel is finally coming to Netflix. Penned by Colombian author Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's, the magical novel has finally been acquired by the streaming giant for adaptation.
The book will be adapted into a Spanish-language series and filmed largely in the Nobel prize-winning author's home country of Colombia, with Garc√≠a M√°rquez's sons, Rodrigo Garc√≠a and Gonzalo Garc√≠a Barcha, serving as executive producers, reported The Guardian.
Garc√≠a said that his father was skeptical of the sprawling magical realist novel's capacity to fit within a traditional film structure, and wanted the story to be told in Spanish.
&quot;For decades, our father was reluctant to sell the film rights to 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' because he believed that it could not be made under the time constraints of a feature film, or that producing it in a language other than Spanish would not do it justice,&quot; Garc√≠a said.
&quot;But in the current golden age of series, with the level of talented writing and directing, the cinematic quality of content, and the acceptance by worldwide audiences of programs in foreign languages, the time could not be better.&quot;

&ldquo;The book follows the Buend√≠a dynasty, founders of the rural and isolated town of Macondo, and fuses fantastical and allegorical elements such as rains of yellow flowers, alchemy and religious apparitions, with realism, history and literary pastiche&rdquo; https://t.co/c0mY4tokKa ‚Äî (((Tim Morton))) (@TimMorton2) March 7, 2019

As Netflix announces that it will adapt 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' my old argument on why it is unjust to brand the great Gabriel Garcia MARQUEZ as a practitioner of a facile form of writing called magic realism. https://t.co/kCLZPqGUJD ‚Äî Manu Joseph (@manujosephsan) March 7, 2019
Netflix itself guarantees you one hundred years of solitude https://t.co/PHhCY3c1VL ‚Äî Karl Sharro (@KarlreMarks) March 6, 2019
now i understand why Spielberg was going so hard after Netflix. He's just bitter about his failed One Hundred Years of Solitude adaptation, of which only one frame remains pic.twitter.com/DwFd7JNFsc ‚Äî Stephen Sajdak (@stephensajdak) March 6, 2019
It became a defining work of magical realism and one of the most celebrated Latin American novels of the 20th century, having sold an estimated 47 million copies and been translated into 46 languages, The Guardian reported.
&quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; will not be the first Garc√≠a Marquez work to be adapted for the screen. The author's 1985 novel &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; was adapted for film in 2007, directed by Mike Newell and starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno, Javier Bardem and Benjamin Bratt.
