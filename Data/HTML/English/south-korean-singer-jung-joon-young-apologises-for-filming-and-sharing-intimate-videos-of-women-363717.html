The news of Jung Joon Young's misdeeds has come as a shock after the news of another K pop singer Lee Seung Hyun aka Seungri emerged where he had been accused of offering sexual services at nightclubs.
The sex scandal has got everyone livid and the fans are devastated.
my heart breaks for jung joon young. He was the first korean artist that I had come to like. This is just so devastating, thinking that it's the second time that he's involved in a scandal. I'm not sure if he can still recover his career after this 😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢 — all hail King Jongdae aka baby dino 🙌❤ (@EXOx1D) March 11, 2019
As a Jung Joon Young stan, I am truly saddened by the news. And I feel betrayed. This will be my last statement regarding his scandal.
I stand with all 10 victims.

Umm, the convo that is very controversial right now happened before jung joon young's scandal.
