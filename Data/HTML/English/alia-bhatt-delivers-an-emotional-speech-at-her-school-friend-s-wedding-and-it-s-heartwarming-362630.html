From Haldi pictures to the pictures of her dressed up as a bridesmaid for various functions, Alia has her fashion game on point.
But currently, the thing that is making the internet gush is her speech as a bridesmaid. While guests chuckled as Alia recalled her childhood memories with the bride, Alia and all her friends got a little emotional.
In her speech, Alia says,
&quot;When I was younger, Bobby and I would play this game called actress-actress. And we made this pact that every time she was at her house she would be the actress and every time I would be at my house I would be the actress. But only that pact was never followed.&quot;
