Turner can be seen walking down the aisle in a stunning white bridal ensemble and veil. The couple announced their engagement in October 2017 after more than a year together.
As per reports, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas also attended the ceremony in the sin-city. Looking at the small gathering, it's easy to tell, the function was nothing like PC's grand marriage back in India.
Prior to this, the Jonas brothers performed at the Billboard Music awards to their popular song Sucker. In fact, they grooved at the award show for the first time after 2009.
2019 is clearly the year of weddings and good luck. Congratulations Mr. Joe and Mrs Sophie Jonas.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
