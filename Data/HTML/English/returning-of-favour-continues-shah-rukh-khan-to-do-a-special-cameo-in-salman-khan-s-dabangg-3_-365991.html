All the newbies and current actors feel the super-stardom will go with them since the kind of fan frenzy, the Khans saw, other actors probably won't.

The Khans have had their ups and down professionally, personally, individually and collectively. SRK has been seeing a string of flops recently with Dilwale, Zero and Jab Harry Met Sejal while Salman juggled with his lovelife and failure of Tubelight.

And who can forget Bollywood's biggest melodramatic brawl that took place between SRK-Salman way back in 2008 at Katrina Kaif's birthday party. The two started their career together, featured in Karan Arjun, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and did cameos in one another's film but all hell broke loose after the mega fight.

The entire nation came together to patch them. Twitter, Facebook, flowers, letters, they tried it all but the fight lasted for almost 6 years. They never spoke ill of each other but they never looked each other in the eye during events.
However, despite media's insane attempts of creating a dramatic rift, the two came together for Baba Siddiqui's Iftaar party in 2013 and kickstarted a second innings of their bromance. So much so, that now SRK always promotes his movies on Salman Khan's Bigg Boss and even featured in Salman's Tubelight.

Salman returned the favour and did a cameo in SRK's Zero. Clearly they are not lucky for each other on the silver screen. But being optimistic, SRK is all set to make a special appearance in Salman's upcoming film Dabangg 3.
Speaking to a leading portal, a source close to the project revealed, &ldquo;Dabangg 3 has a few flashback portions which will trace Salman's journey before he became the Robinhood of the area. There's a character. It's of a man who helps Salman during an important scene. The team was thinking of a few names when Salman decided to call his good friend Shah Rukh to shoot for it. Salman and SRK did a FaceTime call a few weeks back, which is when Salman asked him if he can make an appearance in D3. SRK happily said yes to it.&rdquo;
Well, all continues to be good in the hood. The film also features Sonakshi Sinha in the lead. The movie is slated to release early next year.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
