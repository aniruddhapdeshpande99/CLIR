We met Alia for an interaction for her upcoming film Gully Boy, where she spoke her heart out on her parameters for choosing her films, how being an actor is not a cakewalk and lot more.
When asked how she decides her film choices, she said, &quot;When I take up a film, I only look at the writing of the story and the character. Sometimes what happens is - you may get a film where the character is amazing but the film is not really matching up, so that doesn't balance out for me.&quot;

&quot;Rest the director decides to take whoever he or she wants as your co star, that cannot be my prerogative at all unless I am the producer of the film, which I am not yet.&quot;

Alia shared how much she enjoyed playing Safeena's character in Gully Boy because she is not at all like the character in real life. However, she wished she could be a little like her, &quot;I am a vary hoity toity, a Juhuite, but when I was in my character of Safeena , I pretty much enjoyed it because at the end of the day I am a Mumbaikar and that taporigiri is there in me and I am very proud of it.&quot;

&quot;One of the major things that I enjoyed while doing Safeena's character is that she doesn't have time for nonsense, she says what she wants to, get things done they way she wants, that attitude I loved about her, it's so amazing and freeing. Otherwise as an actor you always have to be correct and say the right things even if you don't want to be correct, it was fun to be incorrect.&quot;
We quizzed her about what's stopping her to not be incorrect, she said, &quot;I am not at all incorrect, I have the need to be good and right in my head and it's very irritating, I wish sometimes I could be bad, but I feel guilty when I am bad. I want people to like me, I don't want to be that person who says anything wrong.&quot;

The talented actress confessed she thoroughly enjoyed shooting Gully Boy because she isn't carrying the film on her shoulder like Raazi which was very stressful for her, &quot;Within three days of shooting Gully Boy I was like 'WoW', this is so much fun because I am not carrying this film on my shoulder like Raazi. In Raazi, I was in every frame, I was portraying this character in a very sensitive way, I was very stressed out but I did it. And in this film I have no tension, Ranveer has to do everything, I have to come do some 'gullu gullu' and leave , I was packing up early, sleeping nicely so I had a blast working on this film, this was my most chilled out film.&quot;

Alia, who herself is a star performer couldn't stop praising Ranveer and his acting skills, &quot;As a performer he has blown my mind, he is fantastic, as an actor he is completely contrast from the person he is in real life. He brings out his energy only because he wants people to be happy around him, he wants to give positive energy all the time, even when he might not be feeling positive all the time and that is an art, people cant do that every time, it's not normal.&quot;

Before ending the interview, when Alia was asked about which character is close to her from all her films so far, she said, &quot;Every role requires you to be a part of yourself which you don't may be have or the part of yourself you have, which you have to dig deep within. I mostly choose roles which are a step away from me, the only role little closer to me was probably Dear Zindagi, so that came a little close to home, apart from that say Safeena who is getting possessive and angry about someone giving attention to her boyfriend, I cant relate to that but I understand, I also can go into my mind and really be jealous and angry about it although I cannot behave that way.&quot;

After Gully Boy, Alia's forthcoming films are Brahamastra with boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor, Kalank which is a multi starrer film and Sadak 2 with Aditya Roy Kapur.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
