In A First, Shahid Kapoor To Appear On Koffee With Karan With 'Wingman' And Brother Ishaan Khatter
This year, Karan Johar's popular chat show Koffee With Karan is all about revelations. After Sara Ali Khan-Saif Ali Khan's grand debut together on national television, KJo confirmed that Brothers Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter too have shot for an episode that will be aired this season.
Sharing the news with the world, Karan shared a photo with the caption, &ldquo;Brothers in arms!&rdquo;.
Shahid and Ishaan shared another photo with the captions &ldquo;Baby boy I always got your back.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your wingman for life&rdquo;.
Ishaan too had earlier confirmed that he will be a part of the show this time. He was quoted in media reports as saying,
&ldquo;Yes, I will be a part of the show with Shahid Kapoor. I am extremely excited. Come on, did you see the hamper. Who would not be excited for that? Donâ€™t be surprised if we do. There is no such plan but yes, you never know.&rdquo;
Just to jog your memory a little, Shahid Kapoor is one of the most popular guests of KJo's show as this will be his sixth appearance. However, for Ishaan who made his grand debut with Dharma Productions' Dhadak, this will be a first.
