The actress is also the face of Loreal and attends the Cannes Film Festival every year but that doesn't give her an excuse to give up on her responsibilities. She's an inspiration to many working mothers, who are always looking at how to juggle work and kids.

Aishwarya Rai was last seen in Fanney Khan which did not perform too well at the box office. On the other hand, Abhishek Bachchan will be seen next in Housefull 4. And on the personal front as we can all see, the parents continue to be doting and shower love to their baby daughter.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
