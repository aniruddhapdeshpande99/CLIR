Arjun Kapoor Slams Trolls For Sending Rape Threats To Anshula For Not Helping Janhvi On KWK
Social media can be a brutal place at times and for Bollywood stars, more often than not, it turns into a different level of hell. For Arjun Kapoor, Anshula Kapoor and Janhvi Kapoor, this situation became real when an episode of Koffee With Karan became a prime reason for trolling and threats.
Just to jog your memory a little, in the last episode of Koffee With Karan, Arjun Kapoor made his first public appearance with sister Janhvi Kapoor. In the last segment of the episode, Arjun and Janhvi had to call up a relative and convince them to say &quot;Hey Karan, what’s up&rdquo;.
While Janhvi was the first one out of the two to call up Anshula, she got torn between the two siblings and didn't do what Janhvi told her to do. While all this happened as a fun-light moment on the show, social media trolls took it to a very different level.
From fat-shaming Anshula to issuing rape threats, some people became over-aggressive after Janhvi lost the round on the game show to Arjun. Janhvi, at SocialForGood live-athon event, revealed that Anshula received rape threats after the episode. She said,

&quot;My sister actually just recently got trolled on social media. She did something silly on Koffee with Karan and started getting like rape threats and stuff. And it was just weird to me. As people are faceless on social media, they feel they can have opinions that sometimes cross a moral line.&quot;
After the situation got intense, Arjun Kapoor too reacted to the whole incident and stood up for her sister Anshula. Slamming trolls for stooping so low, he wrote,

Something I assumed was an absolute non issue on Koffee with Karan has escalated into @anshulakapoor being abused & I can’t be bothered by protocol anymore. F**k all those trolls who wish harm to my sister. I hope ur mom or sister never have to go thru what u have put us thru... — Arjun Kapoor (@arjunk26) November 27, 2018
KJo too reacted to it and urged people to not blur the line between funny and cheap. He said,
I completely agree with you Arjun! Was a harmless fun game and did not warrant this response! People genuinely need to stop this intense negativity.... https://t.co/XITqp1mN6A — Karan Johar (@karanjohar) November 27, 2018</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
