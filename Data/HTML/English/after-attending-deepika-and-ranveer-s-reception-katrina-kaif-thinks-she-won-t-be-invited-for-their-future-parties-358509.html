After Attending Deepika And Ranveer's Reception, Katrina Kaif Thinks She Won't Be Invited For Their Future Parties
Bollywood has had an action packed and lively 2018. Whether it's on-screen with brilliant movies that came and created fireworks or off-screen lavish weddings of A-listers, it has been a fun year, all in all.

In fact, we saw a lot of exes also coming face to face and gracing some occasions. Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai were spotted attending Isha Ambani's sangeet ceremony in Udaipur while Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor were spotted at their wedding in Mumbai.
While no heads turned as they all have been mature enough to move on, one such celebrity who pleasantly surprised us at Deepika-Ranveer's reception was Katrina Kaif. As per reports, Katrina and Deepika have had a difficult past as they both dated Ranbir Kapoor at some point of their lives.

During Koffee With Karan previous seasons too, the two usually avoid answering each other's questions. Right after the two broke up, Deepika also wanted to see Katrina Kaif's passport to know if Ranbir cheated on her.
However, it's all been buried and the two divas have moved on. Katrina looked smashing hot in a white saree during the reception. But after attending the event, Katrina feels she won't be invited for their future parties. And no, cat fight is not the reason.

Speaking during the song launch of Zero, Katrina said,
&quot;I think I ate half of the chocolate and might not be invited to any of their functions again but we had a really wonderful time.&rdquo; She even said that they all danced till the wee hours of the morning and it was really a special party.
Well, all's well that ends well. Although Ranbir Kapoor didn't turn up, Katrina's presence was surely a delightful one.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
