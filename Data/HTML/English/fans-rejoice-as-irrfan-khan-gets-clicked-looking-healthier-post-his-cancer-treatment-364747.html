Irrfan Khan, who is considered as one of the finest actors we have today has been battling cancer since last year but fans did take a sigh of relief when he returned to India in March to resume his work in Mumbai.
&quot;The unexpected makes us grow, which is what the past few days have been about. Learning that I have been diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor as of now has admittedly been difficult, but the love and strength of those around me and that I found within me has brought me to a place of hope,&quot; Irrfan earlier said while sharing the news of his tumor.
Irrfan had earlier requested the paps to not click him and he was seen sporting a mask all through his on and off appearances ever since he returned to India.
However, today, it was a delightful change for all his fans as the actor was spotted without any masks and looked evidently comfortable with the camera and paps.
Have a look at the pictures.
