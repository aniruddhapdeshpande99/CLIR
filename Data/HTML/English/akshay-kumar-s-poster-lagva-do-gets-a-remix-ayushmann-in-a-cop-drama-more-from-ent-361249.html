In the past as well, a lot of people have been criticised after the announcement of Padma awards. However, Manoj Bajpayee is an exception to that.
The makers of Simmba have extended a similar gesture as Rohit Shetty and the team handed over Rs 51 lakh to the Mumbai Police Foundation from the profits of his last film Simmba which was a blockbuster.
He is now actively promoting his upcoming film Gully Boy and doesnâ€™t miss a chance to rap for his fans. But his rap was not the only highlight of his Rajasthan trip.
After the news of Salman Khan collaborating with Rohit Shetty, there is another actor who has signed a cop drama. After back to back hits like Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho, Ayushmann has signed Mulk's director Anubhav Sinha's next. The report states that the film will be set in Uttar Pradesh and will go on the floors in mid-2019.
