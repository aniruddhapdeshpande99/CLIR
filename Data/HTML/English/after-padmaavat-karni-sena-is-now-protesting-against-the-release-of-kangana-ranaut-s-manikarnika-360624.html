Now, that Kangana Ranaut is gearing up for the release of Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi, the Maharashtra Karni Sena has once again created a ruckus. Launching another threat, the Maharashtra Karni Sena has said that if the shooting of Manikarnika isn’t stopped, the makers will face dire consequences.
They have written a letter to the director, producers and the writers of the movie threatening them that if the image of Rani Laxmi Bai is maligned in the movie or if she is shown to be the lover of some Britisher, the makers will have to bear the repercussions. They have also claimed that the movie shows the Queen of Jhansi dancing on a special number, which is against their tradition.
