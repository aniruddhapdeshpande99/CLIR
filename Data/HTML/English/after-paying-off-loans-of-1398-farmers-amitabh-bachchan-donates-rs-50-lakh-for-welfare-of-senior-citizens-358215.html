Amitabh Bachchan is one of the few celebrities who is using his star power for the good. From paying off farmer’s debt to aiding martyr’s families, Amitabh Bachchan has used his celebrity status to make a difference. From Polio To Swachch Bharat Abhiyan, he has attempted to evoke a change with social campaigns too.

And once again, the man is making headlines for his good deeds. The legendary star recently donated Rs 50 lakhs for the welfare of senior citizens to a Gurgaon-based NGO, The Earth Saviours Foundation, which is situated in Bandhwari Village.
The founder of the NGO, Ravi Kalra, had recently participated on Amitabh Bachchan’s show Kaun Banega Crorepati. Big B was moved after Ravi Kalra narrated the stories of the elderly who are abandoned by theory children. So much so, that he promised to donate, and he indeed did.

&ldquo;It was a most moving experience for me and indeed all present during the KBC Karmveer programme that you honoured us with, some days back. Hearing you narrate your stories, was a most horrifying moment for all,&rdquo; Bachchan said in a letter to Kalra.
