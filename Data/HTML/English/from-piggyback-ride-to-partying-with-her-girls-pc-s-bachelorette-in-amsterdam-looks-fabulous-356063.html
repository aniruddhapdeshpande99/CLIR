The festive season is here, and adding to the glory are celebrities including Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas who have more and more reasons to party, rejoice and have fun.
After Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh wedding on Nov 14 and 15, our Desi Girl Priyanka Chopra is also planning to get married soon. Her Bachelorette party is not just restricted to one day. She's had several rounds with her girlfriends and we're sure there are still more to come.

Priyanka Chopra invited her future sister-in-law and Games Of Thrones stars Sophie Turner and bonded quite well in Amsterdam. This video of PC giving Sophie Turner a piggyback ride is a proof!
