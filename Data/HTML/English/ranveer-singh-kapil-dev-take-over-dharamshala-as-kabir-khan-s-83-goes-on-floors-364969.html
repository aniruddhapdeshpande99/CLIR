It isn't a tough nut to crack that the Gully Boy actor is currently immersed completely in the upcoming project which is Kabir Khan's ambitious project on India's iconic world cup victory of 1983.
Titled 83, the film has gone on floors in Dharamshala and Ranveer Singh, along with other co-actors have begun their training session in Dharamshala. The actors are receiving training under the guidance of former Indian cricketers Balwinder Sandhu and Yashpal Sharma.

Ranveer being Ranveer, his caption was as enthusiastic as his persona in real-life. He wrote,
&quot;Kapil's devils descend on Dharamshala. It's on!&quot;
Director Kabir Khan had shared the same picture with the caption, &quot;Team '83 training at high altitude... Dharamshala.&quot;
Apart from training, Ranveer did take time out to meet and greet his fans who reached Dharamshala cricket stadium to catch a glimpse of him. The videos and pictures of Ranveer in Indian cricket jersey, interacting with his fans have been doing rounds on the internet.
