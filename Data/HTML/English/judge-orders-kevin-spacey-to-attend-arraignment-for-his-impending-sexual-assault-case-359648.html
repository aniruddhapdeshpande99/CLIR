The actor indicated his lawyers would enter not guilty pleas on his behalf at the arraignment.
In the supporting documents his attorneys claimed that if Spacey attended the hearing, it would &ldquo;only serve to heighten prejudicial media interest in the case and will increase the risk of contamination of the pool of jurors available for the trial.&rdquo;

The 59-year-old actor has been charged with felony, indecent assault and battery for his alleged role in a 2016 incident inside a Nantucket restaurant.
According to the allegations in Massachusetts, Spacey touched an 18-year-old man against his wishes in a sexual manner inside an eatery in July 2016.
The charges comes more than a year after former Boston TV news anchor Heather Unruh publicly accused Spacey of assaulting her son in July 2016.
