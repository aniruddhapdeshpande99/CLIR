@RanveerOfficial : Tell me something i don't know.
Audience: show us a movie we haven't seen.#simmba #temper — Vigyan Prakash (@science_tweets_) December 4, 2018
While everyone would call it a template cop flick that might not offer anything new, #RohitShetty be like 'tell me something I don't know'.
That said, a shared universe with #singham is quite an interesting touch. #SimmbaTrailer #simba https://t.co/fHMs0iGTjO — Gopinath Rajendran (@gopi_rajen) December 3, 2018
