We asked the actor what made him chose a film like Cheat India, what’s the reason behind his transformation, &ldquo;It happened organically, you can’t expect it to happen overnight. Your personal and professional life experiences have a great influence on the kind of person you become. I think I got a little frustrated and reached a saturation point. In our film industry what happens is, when something works, they really want you to do it again and again, that becomes a safety net. Some of the things I have been doing repeatedly, which became a cliché for me, some of it were life experiences, growing up, thinking that high concept cinema is the next stage for me where I can pitch my audiences. That is why I started fading out. Also, the audiences will take time to accept me in this new avatar.&rdquo;

Emraan admits he has started putting a lot of effort in evolving himself, &ldquo;Earlier it was like things were just coming my way, not that I was not taking it seriously. I was putting a lot of honest work in my films, but there is also a lot of other things to do in part of decision and process, of evolving yourself as an actor, seeing your progress as a whole like where your career is going, these are the things I overlooked back in the day but right now I have started putting in the effort.&rdquo;
Twitter
We quizzed the actor if this is way of saying he is more than a serial kisser, to which he said, &ldquo; It always was, but the problem is this tag became very amusing to people and it started becoming a label. People started associating it with me, but I have really had that misconception that people are only coming to watch that one scene, people come and pay their hard earned money to get a good cinematic experience, my films gained and sometimes the film didn’t work, but the intention was always honest from my side. It’s just that this image took some time to faze out.&rdquo;
Twitter
However, Emraan doesn’t regret doing films that he has done earlier, &ldquo;I don’t regret it because every film made me who I am and where I am as a person, and if I went back I don’t want it to happen in any other way, everything happened to me at the right time. I learned from failures, it was a pleasurable experience. You learn more from failures than successes.&rdquo;
Twitter
We asked him if the audience will accept him with this film, he said he is clueless, &ldquo;I don’t know, I just felt that it’s a story that needs to be told. The education system today is so screwed up in our country that it was a fantastic story that entertains you, informs you and I felt that it should be put out. I don’t know about people’s acceptance, but we have made the film with a lot of honesty, once it releases it will become your film and you will tell us how good, bad or relevant it is.&rdquo;

Emraan even said that box office numbers hold you to take creative decision and he has a valid point, &ldquo;Box office numbers are important to some extent, you want to earn nobody wants to lose, so whenever you make a film you look back on what kind of film worked and you will pick it that holds your creative mind, your mind will tell you not to try new things because it has never been tried so you never know if it will succeed, so better try something that is already a success. That is why it is very important to not make a film on the analysis of box office numbers, you have to a make a film you believe in, hopefully that film will do well at the box office.&rdquo;

When asked if biopics are not true to an extent and it has to come a long way, to which he said,
&ldquo;We have to go a long way in other genres also. We justify bad actions in our films, we justify wrongdoings in films, that is why in Why Cheat India, I am not justifying anything, he is doing everything out of greed, there is no sob story. He is not poverty stricken or someone died in his family so he took up the bad acts.

&quot;In biopics what they do is, first they try to make the character interesting and for that, they make the character endearing, they won’t show the dark qualities of that person, everything has to be likable about him or her, and popular. You don’t actually see the real person in a biopic; it is just a series of Bollywood events taking place in the person’s life which are written and curated to make it interesting.&quot;
Twitter
We asked the actor if he is scared to make his own niche right now in Bollywood as there is lots of competition, he said, &ldquo; We will find out, time will tell, competition here is very fierce, earlier there used to be generation of actors probably after 5 to 10 years, and now it’s after every 3 years, in fact, every year there is a lot of newcomers coming up, so it’s changing in a very rapid pace. It’s very nerve-wracking. Actors are an insecure bunch of people, we fear anonymity and we fear not being relevant.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
