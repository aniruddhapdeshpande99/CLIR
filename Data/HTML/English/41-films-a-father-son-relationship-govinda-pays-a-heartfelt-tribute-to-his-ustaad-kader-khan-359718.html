RIP Kader Khan Saab.
He was not just my &quot;ustaad&quot; but a father figure to me, his midas touch and his aura made every actor he worked with a superstar. The entire film industry and my family deeply mourns this loss and we cannot express the sorrow in words.#ripkaderkhansaab🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/NISPM1UMs1 — Govinda (@govindaahuja21) January 1, 2019
