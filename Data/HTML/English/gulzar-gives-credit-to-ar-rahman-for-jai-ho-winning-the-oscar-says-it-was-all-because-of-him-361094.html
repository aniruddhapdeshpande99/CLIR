Gulzar Gives Credit To AR Rahman For 'Jai Ho' Winning The Oscar, Says It Was All Because Of Him
Gulzar has been penning beautiful songs for Bollywood for a very long time. However, it took a Slumdog Millionaire to be made by Danny Boyle to recognise his talent. With AR Rahman’s brilliant music and Gulzar’s writing prowess to get him his first Oscar nomination.

It has been 10 years since the movie has released, and Gulzar gives all the credit for Jai Ho’s Oscar win to AR Rahman.
&ldquo;It was because of A R Rahman the song won the award. Although Sukhwinder Singh also contributed in making the song a hit by putting a lot of energy into it. Overall, I would say we all agree that it was because of the music maestro A R Rahman that the song won the coveted prize,&rdquo; Gulzar said at the ongoing Jaipur Literature Festival as quoted by PTI.

Gulzar added that writing a song is a tedious job than writing a poem.
&ldquo;A poem is a free flow of expressions. In the song it is not your statement. It is the statement of a story which has a character and a language and a tune which has already been compiled,&rdquo; he said adding that it makes him &ldquo;sad and not angry&rdquo; when he sees the translation of some of his songs on YouTube.

Gulzar thinks that a book cannot entertain people in the way cinema does.
&ldquo;Books may last longer than cinema, but with a book you cannot dance away. The cinema has its own identity. It is a totally different medium. A book cannot be shared with the masses like a song,&rdquo; he said.
