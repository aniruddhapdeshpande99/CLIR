Talking about the hurdles she had to face being a woman, she said,
&ldquo;We have been told for years that we ain’t capable of anything and you obviously get hurt by it, so let it be, what you should do is, reconstruct your pain and move on from that situation. I have made things beautiful for myself and today when I look back, I can truly say that I can face anything. The world will tell you what you should do and you shouldn’t but what did I do with that criticism is important. Did I pick it up and crushed and moved on, that is the true test of time, and according to me, I have done it. It’s not that people have stopped telling you or judging you but I chose a positive road and that is the result of who I am today.&rdquo;

She further went on, &ldquo;No matter what the world says, what important is, how you emerge yourself, because we have to emerge, we have to fly and people will not stop talking, we have to decide whether we let that voice of them affect us or we make that voice music for us, all depends on us&rdquo;.

We quizzed Kubbra what’s the hardest part of being a woman according to her and her answer won us over, &ldquo;The hardest part of being a woman is that I am too beautiful and I mean it, I have never seen the difference between a boy or a girl because that’s not my upbringing, that my brother got this better than me and I haven’t, all this never happened, if I played with a doll even my brother did and even he played with a car even I did, so unfortunately because of this conditioning, I cannot see, ‘oh he is a boy and so he got this opportunity or he is a boy he got it easy,’ but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist, it does. So what is important, is we as women start speaking about the problems we face if you find a problem even in a small thing speak up because unless you won’t speak up it will not be addressed or solved. Once you speak up we will support&rdquo;.
Well, the classic example is the MeToo Movement started by Tanushree Dutta against Nana Patekar.

Talking about her expectations from Women's day 2019, she said, &ldquo;We don’t need a day to celebrate our gender, if this world has given this day to celebrate we should take an advantage of it and try to be the best version of yourself, embrace all things that jack people provide, you just flip it and just see how things work for you. All I want to say to every woman is, ‘You are amazing and no matter what you can face anything.’
