Pyaar Ka Bandhan! Salman Khan Gives SRK A Hug While Watching Karan-Arjun & Fans Are Loosing It!
It’s fun to watch movies with your gang of friends, right? You can laugh, cry and constantly whisper the dialogues.
Well, not only us, but sometimes celebrities watch together too, but rarely their own. But this was an exception.
So, spelling magic of their bromance once again, Salman Khan shared a video in which he can be seen watching Karan Arjun, their iconic movie together, with each other.
This made both of them emotional too. So, much so, that Salman Khan tweeted about it too.
The video, he posted, begins with a shot of screen where Karan Arjun is playing. Moments later, the camera pans 180 degrees and we see Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan watching it together at a party.
They are constantly giving us bromance goals, aren’t they? Just a few days ago, a rare vide of the duo went viral in which they were seen singing Pyaar Hume Kis Mod Pe Le Aaya together.
