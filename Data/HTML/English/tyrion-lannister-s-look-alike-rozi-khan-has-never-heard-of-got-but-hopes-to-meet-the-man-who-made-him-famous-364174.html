&ldquo;I don't mind. A lot of my pictures have been taken, that's why I have become very famous everywhere. Wherever I go, someone says to me: 'Sir, who is this man with you on Facebook', I say that he is my friend. 'He looks like you'. I tell them he is my brother. It's not a bad thing,&rdquo; Rozi Khan was quoted as saying by AFP.

Khan works at small Kashmiri restaurant down a narrow lane in Rawalpindi and serves hearty dishes such as mutton and spinach curries. The owner of the restaurant Malik Aslam Pervez says he is an hard-working employee. &ldquo;When he takes a day off or gets sick, people look for him and ask where did he go? They get upset. They love him. There is always a crowd here but it has boomed because of him,&rdquo; he said.
