Taking to Twitter, Deepika wrote, &quot;Everyone in the industry knows that #AlokNath is an obnoxious drunkard who harasses women. Years ago on a telefilm outdoor shoot he tried to barge into my room. He slobbered over women, drunk and created a scene. The unit rallied around me and made sure I was safe. #metoo

Seeing the number of allegations against the veteran actor, the Indian Film and Television Directors' Association (IFTDA) has issued a notice to him seeking his stand.
Speaking at a press conference, IFTDA president Ashok Pandit said, &quot;The entire federation supports the #MeToo movement. We have already drafted a notice which is to be issued to Alok Nath because Vinta Nanda is also a very respectable member of IFTDA.&quot;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
