&ldquo;I am now bored of playing female characters because I have nothing new to offer to it. Unless it's written well. Now drag is taken for granted. That just because a man is doing a female character, it's funny. It is not! There's no novelty,&rdquo; he told PTI.

Ali Asgar says he wants to play roles that have some newness. He has rejected many comic roles because they were not only caricaturist but also repetitive.
&ldquo;If someone needed a female character in a drag, the channel or production would only approach me. My argument was: why me in a drag? But they used to say audience wants only me in a drag because I do it the best.&rdquo;

Ali says the writing of TV is so weak that he often struggles to add nuances to his characters as there is nothing new to do.
&ldquo;I'm mentally out of playing female characters, unless the material is strong. You at least give me 50 percent character sketch and then I'll bring my own 50 percent nuances to it,&rdquo; he said.
Ali Asgar will next be seen in Amavas, a Bhushan Patel directorial that also stars Nargis Fakhri and Sachiin Joshi in prominent roles.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
