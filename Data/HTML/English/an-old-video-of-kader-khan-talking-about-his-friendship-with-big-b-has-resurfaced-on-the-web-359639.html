An old video that has resurfaced online shows Kader Khan talking about his decades-old friendship with Amitabh Bachchan. These two actors have worked together in films like Coolie, Amar Akbar Anthony, Sharaabi, Lawaaris, and Muqaddar Ka Sikandar.
In this short video, Kader Khan confesses how they drifted apart was because he could never call Bachchan &ldquo;Sir ji.&rdquo;
He says,
&ldquo;I used to always call him Amit. Then one day, a producer from South asked me if I’d met Sir ji. I asked who Sir ji? He pointed towards Amit. I said he is Amit. When did he become Sir ji? But he said ‘We call him Sir ji.’ So all of a sudden, everyone began addressing Amit as Sir ji. I could never bring myself to do it. That was the start of it.&quot;

&ldquo;How can anyone call their friend, their brother from any other name? It is impossible,&rdquo; Khan says, adding,
&ldquo;I couldn’t do it and since then our equation was never the same. I was not in Khuda Gawah. I was writing Ganga Jamunaa Saraswati but then left it midway. There were several other films that I had begun work on but quit.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
