On the other hand, Rohit Shetty who is hailed as the man with hit formula worked his magic with yet another film recently. With his recipe of success, his film Simmba, which stars Ranveer Singh, Sara Ali Khan and Ajay Devgn, has already crossed the Rs 100 crore.

And now, grapevine is abuzz with rumours that a sequel to Simmba is in the works. If a report on Bollywood Hungama is to be believed, Rohit Shetty is planning to make a sequel to the film. If you remember, he even hinted on the same on The Kapil Sharma Show.
&ldquo;Rohit Shetty has not designed Simmba as a one-off occurrence. Ranveer will be back as Simmba again. And this time, Ajay Devgn’s Singham won’t be a cameo like it is in Simmba. In the next Simmba film, Ranveer and Devgn will be fighting corrupt elements as a team,&rdquo; a source told the report.
