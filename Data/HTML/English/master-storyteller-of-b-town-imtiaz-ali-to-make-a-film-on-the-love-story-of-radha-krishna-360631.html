No matter what the genre of the movie is -- horror or thriller -- Bollywood films have always managed to feature a romantic plotline in almost every genre. However, if there’s one filmmaker who perhaps has a unique understanding of a feeling called love, then it is Imtiaz Ali.

Imtiaz Ali films are more or less the same. They follow a known trajectory of a boy meeting a girl, who separates from her only to meet her again and fall in love. Yet, all his films are thought-provoking that leave the audiences mesmerized.

&quot;It was last year on the occasion of Janmashtami that Imtiaz Ali had announced the movie on Radha and Krishna. &ldquo;I am definitely going to make it, but I want to make it on a huge scale and that's what I am thinking. I think it will take time to make it properly. It's a big film but at the same time, I feel that the purity also should come so, it will take time to go on and actually make Radha Krishna,&rdquo; he said.
After Jab We Met, fans have been looking forward to seeing Shahid Kapoor in an Imtiaz Ali film. Some time ago, reports were doing the rounds that the two of them are collaborating for a project. However, Shahid Kapoor later made a statement that the project has taken a back seat.

&ldquo;I can't talk about it because we haven't announced anything regarding it. Now, we are at drawing board and trying to work out things. As of now, nothing is confirmed, but we are working towards a film but right now, I can't say anything about it.&rdquo;
The film on the eternal love story of Radha Krishna is one of the long-cherished projects and close to his heart, said Imtiaz Ali. It will be produced by Reliance Entertainment and Imtiaz Ali's Window Seat Films LLP.
