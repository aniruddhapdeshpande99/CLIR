As Avengers: Endgame Tickets Go On Sale In India, Websites Crash Because Of Mass Bookings
Tickets for the most-anticipated movie of the year Avengers: Endgame went on sale today in India and people from all over the nation went wild to book their tickets for first day first show, because who wants spoilers from friends, colleagues and random strangers?
And this came at a cost, crashing the websites left, right and centre. So, guys, Avengers Endgame isn‚Äôt just a film, it is a phenomenon.
The website of Bookmyshow crashed in some areas of the country because lots of people were trying to book their tickets at the same time apparently.
For the unversed, the Avengers: Endgame tickets went up on sale on BookMyShow, Paytm, as well as the official websites of PVR Cinemas and INOX on Sunday. For Cin√©polis and Carnival Cinemas, the tickets are apparently not live yet.
Don't Miss 264 SHARES 233 SHARES 4.3 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES
If this wasn‚Äôt enough, Paytm is apparently running a contest which offers two free tickets to the film for first day first show. Considering the frenzy of Marvel fans, the websites crashing were no surprise tbh.

Did you manage to book the tickets yet? If you were the lucky one, tell us about it in the comments section below. And by the way, tickets can be booked through Insider as well, in case BookMyShow collapses. But I think, it‚Äôs too late for this information now.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
