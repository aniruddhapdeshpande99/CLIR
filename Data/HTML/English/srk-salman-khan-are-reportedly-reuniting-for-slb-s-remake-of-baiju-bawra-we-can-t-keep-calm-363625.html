In an industry where rumors are very frequent and baseless, it's difficult to figure out what the truth is.
On his birthday, Sanjay Leela Bhansali confirmed that he has roped in his Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam star for a love story, that will also mark their reunion after 19 years. And now, as per recent reports, Bhansali is planning to bring both Salman and SRK together for one of his upcoming projects.
Both the Khans might star in the remake of 1952 Meena Kumari classic Baiju Bawra.
There has been no confirmation from the team's side but reports strongly suggest that Bhansali has reportedly registered three titles - Baijnath, Baiju and Baiju Tansen - for the film. Considering the massive fan following that Salman and SRK have, this would be one interesting project!
