In the battle of Winterfell, when all eyes were glued to Jon Snow, who people thought will kill the Night King, and also Daenerys Targaryen, who seemed most powerful with her dragons, it was Arya Stark who stole the show.

People hailed that she was the real queen, the real hero of Game of Thrones after she stabbed the Night King. Apparently, appearing from nowhere in the darkness, Arya Stark pounced on the Night King, and pulled off a mid-air hand switch to kill the most dangerous villain of the show.

Firstly, it was her who did it. And secondly, how she did it was hell impressive.
And people are so impressed and curious that they are now trying it on their own. And so, #AryaChallenge has taken over the internet.
And it‚Äôs hilarious. Take a look!
