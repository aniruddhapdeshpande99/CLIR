To begin with we asked Adah where she went hiding after 1920, and she said, &ldquo;I don’t think anything went wrong in my career after 1920, I think it went right, I worked 3 years in South to establish myself with the most promising directors, in South where many heroines work in same kind of films, I managed to work with best of the directors and biggest actors. I got roles written for me, Sanam was written for me which was remade in Baaghi, I did commercial and important roles, I got to prove that I can act with my very first film. I had nobody in the industry and I still made so much, I feel I am fortunate.&rdquo;
Adah believes in not crying of not being a privileged kid.
&ldquo;When I started off, I didn’t know anything, I never faced a camera in my life but I still gave my best, I gave everything that I had&quot;.

Talking about nepotism, she said, &quot; I think that’s obvious thing like sunrise and sunsets, but what can be done, I cannot sit and cry about the disadvantage that already exists, so better I focus on my work and make myself the best.&rdquo;
Right now, Bollywood is in its most liberated phase, where every women are sharing about their #MeToo movement, we asked Adah if she even encountered a similar uncomfortable situation, the actress replied,
Twitter
&ldquo;I haven’t been physically molested, raped or touched inappropriately, I would have punched and slapped, but the verbal proposition is something that we all girls and boys must have faced. But I have straightforward said NO and walked out, due to that I have lost many good works but that’s fine.&rdquo;
She further added, &ldquo;I feel not only Bollywood, the entire world is bad and selfish, but we cannot stop looking at the positive side, I like to think that there are people who do good things without any reason.&rdquo;
Adah even recalled the time she was replaced by a star kid in a film last minute, she said, &ldquo;I have lost a film last minute because of one-star kid, but I don’t want to reveal names. I was dashed for a day, I was devastated, but I moved on&rdquo;.
She further said, &ldquo; I am a greedy person and I want to do everything in my acting career, I want to do a nice dance movie which I am doing with Prabhudheva, and that will be my Tamil debut. So good things are happening to me, I can’t just sit and cry about not being a star kid. The only thing is, star kids gets more chances compared to outsiders, they are forced in your faces every day, so even if you don’t like a star kid, they will get 20 more chances and you will tend to start liking them, but with us, if you fail once, you are gone, we don’t get a second chance.&rdquo;
Looking forward to seeing Adah is more Bollywood roles as well.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
