Recently, Alia again opened up about boyfriend Ranbir's acting skills and how she has been a big admirer of his skills. Talking to Mid-day, Alia said,
&ldquo;I have always been a great admirer of his craft. He is an honest actor who extracts the best from himself when in front of the camera. There are no trappings, and even if he has a process, it is an internal one (which translates) on camera.&rdquo;
That's not all. Alia also opened up on Ayan Mukerji's film and she explained how the film is deeply rooted in mythology. She added,

&ldquo;Brahmastra is the biggest astra and has played a crucial role in every important war and every mythological text from the Mahabharata to the Ramayana. Once the story starts unravelling, everyone will understand why we launched it with drones at the Kumbh mela.&rdquo;
Also starring Mouni Roy and Amitabh Bachchan, the film will release in Christmas this year.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
