And looks like this habit of hers landed her in the 'We hate Katrina Kaif' club. If you saw the Katrina-Varun Dhawan episode on Koffee With Karan, you will remember Varun sharing a funny anecdote.
They hated the actress back then because her then boyfriend Salman Khan used to shower all the attention on Katrina, leaving Varun and Arjun on the sidelines. The revelation left the guests and host in splits.

In fact, Katrina too had earlier posted a picture with the duo calling them 'mature' now.
Looks like the boys have realised their mistake as Arjun and Varun have now started a new fan club.
Uploading the image on Instagram, Arjun wrote, &quot;So @varundvn & I are starting a new fan club #WeLoveKK !! Here we are seen awarding her, for absolutely no reason whatsoever... PS - the Dalmatian trophy Katrinaâ€™s holding represents our faithful friendship kyunki yeh dosti #firstclass hai&quot;
It'll be interesting to see this trio coming together for a movie soon. What do you think?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
