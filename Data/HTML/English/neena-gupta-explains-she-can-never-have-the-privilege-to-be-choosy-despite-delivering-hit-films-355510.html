Cut to 2018. This year, Neena has had back to back hits including Veere Di Wedding, Mulk, and Badhaai Ho. She also features in chef Vikas Khanna's &quot;The Last Color,&quot; for which she even attended the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year.
But even with these back to back hits, Neena thinks that she cannot be too choosy when it comes to work, but does the best from what is offered to her. Talking to IANS, Neena said,
