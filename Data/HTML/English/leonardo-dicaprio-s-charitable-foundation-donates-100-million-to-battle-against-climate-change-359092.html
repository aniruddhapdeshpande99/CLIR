&ldquo;When I founded LDF 20 years ago, I did so base on the simple idea that we could make a real difference by directly funding some of the most effective environmental projects. Whether it be individuals, grassroots movements or major non-profits, we wanted to focus on getting critical funding to those who could have the greatest impact. We are extremely proud to celebrate 20 years of this model. Since 1998, we have supported over 200 projects on every continent and in every ocean from habitat and species conservation, renewable energy, climate change, indigenous rights, and more. I am pleased to announce $11 million in new grants across our six program areas, bringing the total financial impact of LDF to over $100 million. (sic)&rdquo;
