After the Pulwama Attack that killed more than 40 of our CRPF jawaans on 14th February, the stars have not just condemned the attack but have done their bit as dutiful citizens.
The stars have proved that they are responsible Samaritans and apart from expressing their opinions on social media and media interviews, their actions are definitely speaking louder than their words.
Now, according to a report in Hindustan Times, Akshay Kumar has vowed to donate ₹5 crore through Bharat Ke Veer — a fundraising initiative of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.
