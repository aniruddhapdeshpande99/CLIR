Because that meant inviting only 200 guests at the wedding!

She was like, ‘I need to have another wedding for the other 150,000 people that I know! How can I not invite my jeweller? How can I not invite my hairdresser?’ So it was a whole conversation,&rdquo; she quipped as she made the revelation at The Ellen DeGeneres Show.
