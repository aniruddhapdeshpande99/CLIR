He returned with his team that included old cast members including Chandan Prabhakar, Kiku Sharda and Sumona Chakravarti, and some new ones like Bharti Singh and Krushna Abhishek.
Bharti Singh said that she approached Kapil Sharma and waited for about nine months to be a part of the show. Krushna Abhishek who has had a tiff with Kapil in the past was also excited for this one.

But Sunil Grover was nowhere to be seen. He is apparently busy with his own show Kanpur Wale Khuranas.
