Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol agreed to be a part of Karan Johar's first film during the shooting of the song 'Tujhe Dekha Toh Yeh Jaana Sanam'. Johar was Chopra's assistant director along with Uday Chopra.

DDLJ is the epitome of cult romance in Bollywood and will always remain an all time favorite. It's one of the rare movies you end up watching till the end whenever it runs on television. Thank you for giving us Raj and Simran and so many beautiful memories. #23YearsOfDDLJ https://t.co/Xv4VTlNRVA — Sara Naveed (@SaraNaveed) October 24, 2018</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
