&ldquo;'Robot' almost influenced the climatic moments in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'... In one of the final scenes all the Ultrons were suppose to form a large Ultron and Avengers were set to fight that but the sequence got cut for time. It was this close. I was inspired directly by 'Robot',&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by PTI.
What’s more? The ace filmmaker has watched Salman Khan’s Dabangg and he feels the camera work in the movie was amazing. I'm an action director so I saw 'Dabangg' many years ago. I still have to see 'Dabangg 2'. I thought the camera work was great in those movies. The tone and the energy is also great. So, I certainly know Salman Khan,&quot; he added.
Apart from this, he even said that he finds Priyanka Chopra fantastic and would love to work with her. &ldquo;Priyanka is transitioning into global status now. She is fantastic... (I would) Love to work with her... I am potentially talking to Priyanka for something. I am not going to say what it is.&rdquo;

Marvel is anyway working on a standalone movie on Ms Marvel AKA Kamala Khan. When the news was announced, fans expressed their wish to see Priyanka Chopra as Marvel's first Muslim superhero. Will Russo brothers cast him in that role? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, Avengers: Endgame is slated to release on April 26.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
