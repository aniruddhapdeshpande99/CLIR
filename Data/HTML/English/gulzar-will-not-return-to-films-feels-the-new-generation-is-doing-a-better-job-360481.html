Gulzar Will Not Return To Films, Feels The New Generation Is Doing A Better Job
He is a poet, writer and a filmmaker of Bollywood and has created some phenomenal masterpieces. He has won several national awards and the Padma Bhushan award in 2004. But now eminent lyricist-filmmaker Gulzar says there is no need for him to return to film direction as the new generation is making movies &quot;more cinematic&quot; and better than him.
Gulzar has helmed several celebrated films in his career such as &quot;Ijaazat&quot;, &quot;Aandhi&quot; and &quot;Angoor&quot;. His last directorial was &quot;Hu Tu Tu&quot; in 1999.
When asked if he plans to return to direction, Gulzar told reporters, &quot;I don't need to return to films because the ones who are walking ahead of me, whose fingers I am holding, they are Shilpa (Ranade), Meghna (Gulzar), Vishal (Bhardwaj).

&quot;They are making good films, Vishal has made a film on children, Meghna had made films on relevant topics too.&quot; The writer, who last penned dialogues and screenplay for &quot;Mirzya&quot; in 2016, said now is the time of young filmmakers.

&quot;Let me sit back. They are making films which are better than me, cinematically. I might've had some thoughts earlier in my films but they weren't so cinematic and good as these films are now, made by this generation. I think they are much ahead of me, I can't pace off that fast.&quot;

Gulzar, 84, said he is doing his own by penning books and writing for children. The lyricist-director was speaking at the trailer launch of &quot;Goopi Gawaiya Bagha Bajaiya&quot; is an animated film directed by Ranade.

&quot;Film is not the only medium to work for children. There are so many others and all have to be looked after. Animation is a very big medium where you can make wonderful, meaningful and entertaining films,&quot; he added.
