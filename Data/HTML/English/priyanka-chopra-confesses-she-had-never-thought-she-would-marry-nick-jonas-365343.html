Recently at a panel discussion, Priyanka admitted that she wasn’t sure if she wanted to get married to Nick, but clearly, it turned out to be the best decision of her life.
The actress said, &ldquo;I’ve known him for two years. I didn’t think that this is what it [would’ve] turned out to be, and that’s maybe that’s my fault, I judged a book by its cover&rdquo;. PC taught us - what not be next time when you meet a guy.

Well, it’s difficult to find a man who equally supports your passion like you do, but guess what, our desi girl got extremely lucky here. Talking about how Nick surprises her every time with all the support, she said,
&ldquo;I call him ‘Old Man Jonas.’ That’s my name for him, ‘OMJ' He’s such an old soul, extremely smart, so good for me because he grounds me so much. I’m a wild child, I do whatever I want whenever I want and he always supports me&rdquo;. Clearly, Priyanka is madly and deeply in love with Nick and why she shouldn't be?

When Priyanka and Nick’s wedding news was out, she faced a lot of criticism, especially due to the age gap between the beautiful couple, but they stood by each other and here they are. She was even called a global scam artist by a New York magazine after getting hitched to the pop sensation. Later they apologised and deleted the racist article on her. In fact, just recently there were rumours of their separation, but they are intact like never before.
Well, Priyanka and Nick's love story does make you believe in fairy tales. Do you guys agree?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
