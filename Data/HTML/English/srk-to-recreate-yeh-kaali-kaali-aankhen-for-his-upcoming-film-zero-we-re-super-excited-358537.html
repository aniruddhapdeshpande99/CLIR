And unlike other remixes, Shah Rukh Khan himself will feature in the new version. We're wondering if the makers of the film will rope in the original diva, Kajol or will they use the cast of the film, Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif.
Zero is SRK's most expensive film as it's made on a budget of Rs 200 crore. The film releases on 21st December, 2018. For those who haven't seen the original song, take a look.
