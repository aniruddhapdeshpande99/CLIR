How will they beat Thanos after Infinity War? How will the fallen heroes be resurrected? Will they be at all? Here are some of the best Avengers Endgame theories we saw online.
1. Where we're going, we don't need roads
Yeah that's a line from Back To The Future, and for good reason. Though people were already thinking it, recent leaks have confirmed that there are indeed a bunch of time travel shenanigans involved in this movie. One theory is that the heroes are split into teams, with one facing off against present day Thanos while the other goes back in time to steal the Infinity stones, thus changing the timeline.
However, we know just how dangerous that can be too. So another addition to the theory suggests that maybe the heroes doesn't steal the gems at all, but rather parts of them. And then they form a new Infinity Gauntlet from the piece of Mjollnir to fight Thanos.

2. Thanos taking care of business
One of ideas being presented is that Thanos is attempting to destroy the Infinity Stones so that no one can unmake what he's wrought. In that case, this could be the perfect way to set up an initial battle with Thanos, before the heroes realise they have to go back in time to have any success.
Maybe the mad titan even destroys the stones before their eyes, which is what forces them to rethink the situation.
3. There's something Strange in the neighbourhood
A popular is that Dr Strange, being the Sorceror Supreme, isn't dead in a final kind of way. We see Gamora in a dimension within the Soul Stone, meaning the gem traps the souls of those it kills. So when Strange died in the Snap, it's possible that's where his soul is too.
However, over time he's also mastered the art of astral projection, which is the ability to send your consciousness across space and time. That's why one theory is that Strange is able to project his soul out of the Stone and appear to his team members, perhaps to lend aid as the only person to have foreseen how the Avengers defeat Thanos.
4. Missing links
Though there are plenty of dead heroes in this flick (at least to start with), there are plenty just plain missing. Hawkeye makes an appearance looking like tragedy has befallen him. It probably means his family were killed in the Snap, something he wouldn't have known about since he wasn't there fighting Thanos. Maybe his initial appearance in the movie is him trying to find answers, before Black Widow encounters him.
As for Ant Man, well the last we saw him he was trapped in the Quantum Realm. Because of its nature, the Quantum realm is outside the boundaries of space and time, so there are two possibilities here. Either he somehow manages to make his way back and leads some of his allies through the Quantum Realm and into the past (hence the fancy white suits), or he's already in the past somehow.
5. Another one bites the dust
The filmmakers have already confirmed that at least one of the Avengers will die in this movie, probably for good. In that case, there are a lot of options. For instance, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth are all supposed to be ending their contracts after Endgame. That leaves a variety of possibilities for their characters, from death to retirement. However, it's been theorized that Cap will be the one to fall, either in an initial clash or when wielding their slapdash Infinity Gauntlet (see above).
It all ties together with the comic books anyway, where all three leading men are replaced by allies or sidekicks. And as far as Marvel goes, it allows them to bring in a set of younger faces more on a level with the new Peter Parker. Maybe Captain Marvel will be the one to lead them too.
