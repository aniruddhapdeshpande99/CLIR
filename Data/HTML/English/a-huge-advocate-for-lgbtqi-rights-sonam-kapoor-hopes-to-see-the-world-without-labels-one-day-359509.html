A ‘Huge Advocate’ For LGBTQI Rights, Sonam Kapoor Hopes To See The World Without Labels One Day
Breaking stereotypes, Sonam Kapoor is playing the role of a lesbian character in her next film Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. With the entire nation celebrating decriminalisation of homosexuality, the movie is perfectly timed.
A strong supporter of LGBTQI rights, Sonam Kapoor says she is a strong supporter of basic human right – the right to be themselves.
Actress Sonam K Ahuja says she is a &quot;huge advocate&quot; for LGBTQI rights, and hopes to see a world without labels one day.
&quot;I'm a huge advocate for LGBTQI (Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex). For me, it is one of the most important things that I fight for and I hope for when there is a country and a world without labels,&quot; Sonam said in a statement.

&quot;I'm very happy and proud that India has taken a step forward and people can live and love the way they want to love and that's very important to me. And I think it should be very important to everybody in this world,&quot; added the actress.
Sonam expressed her views on the issue in an episode of &quot;Koffee with Karan&quot; season 6. She joined the chat show with her sister Rhea and brother Harshvardhan. The episode will air on Star World on Sunday.
