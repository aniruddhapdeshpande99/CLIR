Valentine Week Is Here! Farhan Akhtar Pens Down A Poetic Note For Lady Love Shibani Dandekar
Love is all about spending time together and exchanging smiles and for Shibani Dandekar and Farhan Akhtar, this holds perfectly true.
Farhan and Shibani have been seeing each other since 2018 and their social media PDA has caught attention of all their fans and for all the right reasons. From holidaying together to spending sundays together, the couple is making the most of their courtship days.
Rumor mills have also claimed that, wedding bells might ring soon for the couple in the first quarter. However, neither of the two have given an official nod in the media. However, their PDA says it all.
Recently, Farhan posted a picture with Shibani and his poetic avatar is what turned our hearts into a pool of mush.
