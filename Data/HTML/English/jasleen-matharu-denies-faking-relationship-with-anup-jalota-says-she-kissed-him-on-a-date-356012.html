It raised a lot of eyebrows and had set numerous tongues wagging. People kept wondering if they were seriously in a relationship or was it all a publicity stunt for the longest time until Anup Jalota was evicted from the house.

Earlier having hinted that he was indeed in a romantic relationship with Jasleen Matharu, Anup Jalota took a U-turn after he was evicted from the house. Hours after his elimination, he said that he was never dating Jasleen and that they only shared a &ldquo;musical relationship&rdquo; of a Guru and Shishya, disciple if you may. He said that he was shocked when Jasleen called him her boyfriend but later chose to play the game according to her plan.
