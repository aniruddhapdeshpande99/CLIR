&ldquo;I do know that the script is pretty much ready. I do know from Raju [Rajkumar Hirani] that the film will go on floors this year - either mid or the end of the year. The work on the script is going on. As of now, yes it's Sanju and me. These are the things I've been told,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by PTI

The story will pick up right from where the second instalment ended. Talking about the character of circuit, Arshad said, &ldquo;I tend to do my film and forget about my character and I move on to the next one. I tend to forget, which is what happened with Munna Bhai. When I came for the second part, I was doing the same role differently. I realised something isn't quite right. Then Raju and I saw a couple of scenes from the first one and remembered how I should be doing. This time too, I'm sure I'll do it.&rdquo;
