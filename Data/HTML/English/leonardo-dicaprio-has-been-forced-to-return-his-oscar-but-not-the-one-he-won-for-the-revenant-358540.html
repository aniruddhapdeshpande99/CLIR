Leonardo has another Oscars’ trophy. According to New York Times, he has another trophy which was won by Marlon Brando in 1954 for his performance in On the Waterfront. It is said that Leonardo DiCaprio got this trophy from Malaysian financier Jho Low, who is being investigated for alleged fraud. So, Leonardo has been asked to surrender all the gifts that he got from him that include Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat artworks.
The Oscar trophy went reportedly missing from Brando’s home and it is said that the same was bought for $600,000 (Rs 4.3 crore) by Jho Low years later. Furthermore, the report states that Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has the right to buy the Oscar back for $1 once the investigations are completed.
