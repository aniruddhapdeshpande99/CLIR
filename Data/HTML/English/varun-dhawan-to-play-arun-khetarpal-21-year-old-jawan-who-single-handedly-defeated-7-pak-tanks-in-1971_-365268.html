TOI
&ldquo;Sriram Raghavan who has brought out a different facet to Varun’s talent with ‘Badlapur’ (2015) is extremely fond of the actor’s choices. He is currently busy finishing writing the script of his next film which happens to be a biopic. Titled ‘Ekkis’, it will be produced by Dinesh Vijan. The Gen Y star has been spotted several times at Maddock office which also was the reason why many claimed he might replace Rajkummar Rao in ‘Stree 2’. But it’s not the case. He’s being considered for this film instead,&rdquo; a source was quoted as saying by Bollywood Bubble.
