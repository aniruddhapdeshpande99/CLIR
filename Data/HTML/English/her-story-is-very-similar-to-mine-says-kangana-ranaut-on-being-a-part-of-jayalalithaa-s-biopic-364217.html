Confirming all the reports, Kangana confessed that she always looked forward to working on regional films. She said,
&quot;I always wanted to do regional films. When we go to Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh, they mainly watch only South cinema. There is a lot of disconnect with that part of the country. So, I always wanted to get a good opportunity to do work there. This just came my way. I was planning to make my own biopic. The work was going on but Jayalalithaa’s story is very similar and a far bigger success story than mine. When I heard the narration, I found it so similar (to her own biopic). We will be doing the film mainly in Tamil. It will be released in Hindi as well. I will learn Tamil.&rdquo;
Kangana already has three National Awards in her kitty and she said that she's expecting another one for Manikarnika. Talking about the same, she said,

&quot;I feel there are certain things which if you will not respect, then it is, in turn, disrespectful for that organisation itself. So, if I or my film 'Manikarnika...' doesn't win at National film awards, then it will question credibility of that award ceremony but if I come across other good work then, I will be objective enough to say it's better than me. I think last year, Tabu ji gave an amazing performance in 'Andhadun'. I am floored by what she has done. I think in coming year, it will be revealed. If there will be a better performance than 'Manikarnika', I will definitely appreciate that but I don't think it will happen.&quot;
Kangana is currently gearing up for her next release &quot;Mental Hai Kya&quot; along with Rajkummar Rao.
