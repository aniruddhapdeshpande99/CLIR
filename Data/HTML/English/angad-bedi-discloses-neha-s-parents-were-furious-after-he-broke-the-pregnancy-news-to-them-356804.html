While narrating the story, Angad mentioned how Neha’s mother got hyper after listening to this unexpected 'expecting' news. Talking to Neha, he said,
&ldquo;Considering that you didn’t want to break the news that you were expecting, so we had to tell them that we need to get married and we love each other. I was extremely nervous because that was the judgment day, technically. To break the news to your parents, I really had cold feet as clearly it was not going to come from you (Neha). Everything had to come from me. I had to really man up and speak. I just had to blurt it out and see the reaction&rdquo;.

The Tiger Zinda Hai actor even revealed his parents yelled a lot at him,
&ldquo;I don’t think that they were really prepared for the fact to hear the news that you were expecting.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You know what? We are going to have a baby!&rdquo; Bohot jhaad padi.&rdquo;
It takes guts to reveal such facts especially to Indian parents and we're glad it all worked out for them in the end.
