According to a Mid Day, one woman who shared her #MeToo story revealed that she met Malik in 1990 at Mehboob Studios to record a song. She recalled how Malik rubbed his body against her and had also offered her a meek apology when he found her shaken by his advances.
She further recollected how when she met him for the second time for a fundraiser event, he again tried to make inappropriate sexual advances towards her. She was quoted as saying,
&ldquo;He simply unzipped his pants and asked me to lick him. I told him no and urged him to let me go, but he pulled me by my hair and stuffed my face in his lap, hurling abuses as he did so.&quot;
Another victim recollected her struggling days in the music industry. She added how Malik during their second meeting at Sahara Studios in Goregaon asked her if she had a boyfriend. When she said no, he said 'you must be so lonely'. She added how Malik asked her to wear a chiffon saree next time they meet. She added,

&quot;When I tried to leave, he grabbed me and hugged me while running his hands over my body. We were in a soundproof recording studio hence I could not even scream. I pushed him away which is when he said that 'I am happy with my wife, I am a sensitive man'.&quot;
Malik is yet to comment on the fresh allegations put on him.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
