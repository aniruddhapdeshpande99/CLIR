Talking about the film, she said,
&quot;I have never won a medal in school. Who would have thought about a biopic being made on me? I am thankful to Meghna Ji for considering my work worthy enough to be converted into a film.&quot;
She added that the film will be like a tight slap on her attacker's face. She added,
&quot;I am also elated that a celebrity like Deepika is playing me. I just want to say that this film will be a tight slap on that attacker who thought he has ruined my life and to the society who looked at me like a criminal.&quot;
She also explained how she felt when the first look of the film was out. She had said,
&quot;I saw a lot of makeup artists on social media recreating Deepika's look from the film. Unhone vaisa makeup karke apni photos mujhe bheji hui hain. Kabhi socha nahi tha ki ek acid-attack survivor ke face ko bhi log recreate karenge.&quot;
The film is already being touted as one of the most promising films and Meghna Gulzar is targeting an early January release in 2020.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
