Been a fan of @akshaykumar since I was a teenager; back when political leanings didn't interfere in my liking of individuals. I still adore him but it's sad to see how he's been helping to further party propaganda. Also it's high time he clarifies the mystery of his nationality. â€” The Drowsy Goofball (A.)

While celebrities are the softest targets to these attacks on the internet, it's sad to see how old videos that make way manage to spark such controversies. Akshay is yet to make a comment.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
