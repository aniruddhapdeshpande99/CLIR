Here's The Teaser For The Final Season Of Game Of Thrones And It's A Battle Of Fire And Ice
The much awaited first teaser of the final season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; has been unveiled.

The teaser, titled Dragonstone (which is the ancestral seat of House Targaryen), starts by showing ice apparently taking over Westeros. Some theories say that the clash between fire and the ice is when the Dragonstone forms.
The 54 second-long clip promises to show a battle between fire and ice. Watch.
The internet is in a bit of shocking after watching the teaser. While some are elated, some are upset that the teaser does not show anything.
