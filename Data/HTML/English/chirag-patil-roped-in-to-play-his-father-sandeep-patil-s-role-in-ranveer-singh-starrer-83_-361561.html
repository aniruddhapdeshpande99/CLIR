&ldquo;I’m really excited, the ’83 World Cup win is considered a milestone in Indian history and to be a part of that team is a dream come true and playing my father who’s my hero is just awesome. I don’t think any actor has ever played his father on screen, I’m a first.&quot;
Even though his father was into Cricket, Chirag confirmed that he himself has never played cricket professionally and that made him a little hesitant to take up the role. He added,

&ldquo;Ballu uncle (Balwinder Sandhu) and his team have been training us since August. I also took some training sessions at Chandrakant Pandit’s Cricket Academy (CPCC) whenever free time. The best cricket coach in India stays in my house and that’s a big help. Right now the focus is to train well and get my father’s style right.&rdquo; And after that-Sachin Tendulkar had once told me, 'Give your best and leave the rest to God.' I follow that philosophy.&quot;
Apart from Chirag, Punjabi actor and Ammy Virk too was roped in for the project and he will be playing the role of Balwinder Singh Sandhu. It is supposed to be Virk’s Bollywood debut.
