Despite Criticism & Bad Reviews, 'Zero' Becomes The 10th Highest Grossing Film Of 2018 Globally
The SRK starrer Zero was released with much anticipation in Bollywood, however it tanked almost immediately. Directed by Anand L Rai, the movie is about a man featuring Shah Rukh Khan, who is short in stature but big on love and how he meets two different women who help him broaden his horizon.

The movie was launched with high expectations as it was a Khan film and after a very long time, fans were looking forward to the SRK-Anand L Rai collaboration. King Khan, who was last seen in Jab Harry Met Sejal came back with this movie and it was touted to be a mega hit with the coolest VFX.
However, as per trade analyst Taran Adarsh, after opening with Rs 20 crore, the movie saw a dip in the first weekend only and was called 'disappointing'. The movie barely managed to get the crowd in the hall and the word of mouth ruined it further.
