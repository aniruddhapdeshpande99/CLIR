2 years into my abusive relationship
I resorted to self harm. When my abuser would threaten or attack me, I cut my wrist as a way to disarm him. It only made the abuse stop temporarily. At that point I was desperate to stop the abuse and I was too terrified to leave. #IAmNotOk pic.twitter.com/VtZ1cA7JdB â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 11, 2019
The day of this photoshoot, I was so weakened by an abusive relationship. I was emaciated, severely depressed, and could barely stand. I fell into a pool of tears and was sent home for the day. #IAmNotOk pic.twitter.com/aVUQ1w8ayQ â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 11, 2019

#IAmNotOk because I had to pretend like I was ok when people were around me and my abuser, But they never knew what happened when they left and I was alone with him. â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019
#IAmNotOk because my abuser forced me to do things on video that I hated so that he could use it against me if I ever talked. #revengeporn #blackmail
Is #DomesticViolence â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019
#IAmNotOk because when I tried to tell certain partners about my past abuse, they blamed me or wouldnt listen. It was never safe to open up fully because I felt like they wouldnt understand, and I couldnâ€™t handle anymore shame or guilt. â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019
#IAmNotOk because when I was worried someone close to me was being abused, I was told to calm down and it was just &ldquo;my trauma&rdquo; talking.
But it was my experience and wisdom talking. Hysteria comes when no one believes or listens to you. â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019
I hope #IAmNotOk encourages people to ask &ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;
And empowers someone in an abusive situation to say
&ldquo;I am not ok.&rdquo; And they wont have to say anything else. Weâ€™ll know. ðŸ’œ â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019
#IAmNotOk because if you research how to leave an abusive relationship online, most websites have a quick exit button, in case your abuser catches you looking for a way out. â€” #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 13, 2019
After her story, many other people came out to share their sorrows.
#IAmNotOk
A loved one is in an abusive relationship. And it effects me. I am not physically in that home, but the abuser is powerful beyond walls â€” ðŸ¦„BraveByDesign (@Marieluvunivers) March 14, 2019
I didn't know how to get out. First lawyer I asked for help said that divorce would bankrupt me. He told me to work harder and save up some money and maybe I'd be able to leave in a few more years. He told me I had made a bad choice and needed to face the consequences #IAmNotOk â€” Katie (@ktkipper) March 13, 2019
The fact that I not only lived, but got out, is still miraculous to me. But even though I've done a lot of healing, #IAmNotOk and I'm not sure I ever will be again. â€” Katie (@ktkipper) March 13, 2019
#IAmNotOk because being made to believe your feelings are invalid and irrational, to feel like youâ€™re always wrong and in the wrong, is no way to live in a relationship. Emotional abuse matters too â€” Eden Neidert (@edenrose95) March 13, 2019
#IAmNotOk because I cannot snap out of this severe depression/chronic anxiety from the CPTSD as a result of the domestic abuse that he denies he did, or that it ever even occured. The only people that know the truth are my closest friends, and I pretend to the world that I am ok. https://t.co/TZeUzHXbfj â€” *Nameless Narrator* (@SlowBoiledFrog) March 13, 2019
#IAmNotOk and sometimes when people get angry at me I am suddenly 8 years old again, being hit by a man twice my size that until then had groomed me into thinking he cared about me and was a loving and caring step father. â€” Beate (@beaterast) March 13, 2019
My ex tried to kill me twice. I testify this summer in his criminal trial. He verbally, mentally, financially, physically and emotionally abused me for years. One day I had enough and got out. I have perm scars and injuries from it. I have post-concussion syndrome. #IAmNotOk â€” Surviving Hell (@HellSurviving) March 13, 2019
We have all been a part of #IAmNotOk at some point of our lives. While some talk about it, some are still not ready but more power and love to those who have the courage to go out there and talk about their issues around domestic violence.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
