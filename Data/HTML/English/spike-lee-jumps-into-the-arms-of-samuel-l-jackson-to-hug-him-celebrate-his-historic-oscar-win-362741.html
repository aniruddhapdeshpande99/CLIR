As Spike Lee won his first ever Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay in BlacKkKlansman, he couldn’t contain his excitement. He walked on to the stage and excitedly jumped into the arms of Samuel L. Jackson.
This moment right before he got down to his real political speech is winning applause.
In his speech, he said, &ldquo;The 2020 presidential election is around the corner. Let’s all mobilize, let’s all be on the right side of history. Make the moral choice between love versus hate. Let’s do the right the thing! You Know I had to get that in there.&rdquo;
