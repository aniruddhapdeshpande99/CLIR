&ldquo;I’m truly happy to learn that Padosan figures in the count of top 100 films of India on IMDb,&rdquo; Saira said in a statement.
She co-starred in the film with Sunil Dutt, Kishore Kumar, and Mehmood. Directed by Jyoti Swaroop, the comedy film is about a simple man from a village who falls in love with his fashionable and very urban neighbor. He enlists the help of his musical-theatre friends to woo the girl-next-door away from her music teacher who always seems to be around her. It is a remake of the Bengali film Pasher Bari.

&ldquo;Padosan came to me in the early stages of my career when I was myself a carefree, extremely happy and lively young woman full of the joie de vivre that comes when one’s dreams come true. Much of the vibrancy you can see in the character of Bindu is a reflection of my real personality at that time. Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed my work and I was effortlessly standing up to the formidable talents of my co-stars who were brilliant in comedy and very popular and respected actors,&rdquo; the actor said.

Looking back, the actor, who got married to Dilip Kumar in 1966, said: &ldquo;I was newly married to Dilip saheb and I received the highest compliment any actor can receive when he watched the film and commended my innate sense of precise comic timing.&rdquo;
Saira, 74, turned emotional as she recounted fond memories of her mother Naseem Banu, who &ldquo;took pains to design the beautiful saris and dresses I wore in the film which became trendsetters&rdquo;.
