In an interview earlier, Shahid Kapoor had revealed what drove him to sign this project.
&ldquo;I usually don’t watch too many films in Telugu and it surprised me with its tonality, rawness, simplicity and the fact that it was so real and believable. The character is very fascinating for me as an actor because the emotional arc... is very original. I loved it and Vijay Deverakonda, who played Arjun, did it so well,&rdquo; he said.
We are eagerly waiting for this one. What about you?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
