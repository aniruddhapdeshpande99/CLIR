BORING, right? If you are a Punjabi pop fan, you sure must have heard of the popular singer. If not, you would have of course listened to songs including Suit Suit from Hindi Medium, Ban Ja Tu Meri Rani and Lahore. The mesmerizing voice behind these songs is of Guru Randhawa.
Twitter
From singing foot-tapping Punjabi songs to making his way in Bollywood, Guru Randhawa is a big star now. For the uninitiated, he is the only Indian to have made it to the Billboard Top 25 songs on YouTube. His song Lahore had secured the 21st spot in the list, in January this year.
And now he is all set to win hearts abroad. So, after Priyanka Chopra’s Exotic, Guru Randhawa is collaborating with American Rapper Pitbull for his song Slowly Slowly and fans are hailing ‘Let it rain over me’.
