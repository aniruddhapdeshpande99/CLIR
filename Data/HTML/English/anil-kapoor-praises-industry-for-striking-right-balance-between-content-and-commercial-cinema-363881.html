&quot;There is a place and audience for all types of cinema - content and commercial and our industry has balanced it well. Films with good content are making good money at the box office. This is all because audience is more evolved than ever before. Audiences have evolved and so films have evolved to better resonate with that change. I don't think it's a matter of films being better or worse. It's a matter of being the reflection of the times,&quot; Kapoor told PTI.
This year the actor has had two releases -- &quot;Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga&quot; and &quot;Total Dhamaal&quot;. The films minted Rs 43 crore and Rs 145 crore, respectively. Kapoor said he has been experimenting with every film and is happy about it.

&quot;There is a sense of self-growth and fulfilment and the feeling of a job well done. I take pride in that.&quot;
