People left everything and started beating him. So much so, that he was left bruised and bloody right in front of the theatre.
Not that we are endorsing violence but why would anyone pull off such a stunt? I mean, don’t even try to put up spoilers on social media. Some Marvel fan will find you and come to your home to beat you up. Be a true Marvel fan. Enjoy Avengers: Endgame and let others enjoy it too. For true Marvel fans, it’s an experience of a lifetime. Don't ruin it.
