&ldquo;Not at all. I feel there is a need for such characters in our films. The film does not solely work on a single hero. It takes proper teamwork and coordination to make a film hit,&rdquo; he said.
He further added,
&ldquo;If filmmakers feel I am capable of such roles, there is nothing about being typecast. It all depends upon relevant roles and scripts.&quot;
