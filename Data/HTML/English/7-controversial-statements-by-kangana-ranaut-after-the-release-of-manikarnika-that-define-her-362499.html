For an A-lister, Kangana is too bold, brazen and outspoken. Some people have even labelled her as the Rakhi Sawant of Bollywood but does that stop Kangana from saying out loud. Nope.
Being an outside, Kangana has fearlessly called out sexism, nepotism and pay parity in the industry. She even went on publicly to speak about her alleged relationship with Hrithik Roshan.

As per reports, Kangana reportedly lost out on many projects because of her apparent arrogance but she turned around and said that she is not interested in working with the Khans.

But with her box office collection, Kangana proved she is getting better at her Bollywood game. But she trolled back at celebs and created controversies like never before. Here's taking a look at 7 controversial statements, Kangana Ranaut has said after the release of her film.
1. Kangana Ranaut criticises Shabana Azmi
Kangana was quoted in a DNA report, saying, &quot;People like Shabana Azmi calling for halt on cultural exchange - they are the ones who promote Bharat Tere Tukde Honge gangs... Why did they organise an event in Karachi in the first place when Pakistani artists have been banned after Uri attacks? And now they are trying to save face? The film industry is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies' morals in many ways, but right now is the time to focus on decisive actions... Pakistan ban is not the focus, Pakistan destruction is.&quot;
2. Kangana Ranaut lashes out at Alia Bhatt, calls her spineless
Speaking with a leading entertainment portal, Kangana was furious with Alia and said, &ldquo;I reached out to Alia (Bhatt) and asked her what makes her think Manikarnika is my personal controversy, it’s a film whole nation is talking about and wondering why Bollywood is keeping quiet on such a relevant work. I asked her if I can be courteous and gracious to acknowledge her requests for encouraging relevant work that she does, why is she so scared to see my film.&quot;
&quot;I suggested that she grows some spine and support an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism....if she doesn’t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo (Karan Johar) puppet then I don’t consider her successful... I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value.... hope she understands the true meaning of success and her responsibilities,&quot; she added.
3. Kangana hits back at Manikarnika's co-director Krish
The minute the movie released, Krish came out tp speak about the film. Hurt how he was second in name in the director listing of Manikarnika, Krish claims 70% of the film shown was under his direction.
Hitting back at him, Kangana said, &quot;Nothing succeeds like success. These people would have disowned the film if it was bad. These are the people who had abandoned it. [But] this is a good fight, where the cast and crew are bickering over who owns the movie more. We were able to make a clean film, no one has blamed me for distorting history. Personally, there is no controversy of great magnitude here. I don't see any negativity attached to it outside the industry. I am satisfied with the audience's response.&quot;
4. After Manikarnika, Kangana all set to direct her own biopic to show the Bollywood hardships
Without the backing of any Khans or a mega production house, Kangana has decided to direct her own biopic. &quot;My story from rags to riches has extreme highs and deepest lows, it will make for a great cinematic experience,&quot; Kangana said in a statement.
&quot;I am very excited and look forward to sharing what seems unbelievable even for me... My story is more magical than magic itself,&quot; added the actress, who is still getting rave reviews for 'Manikarnika - The Queen of Jhansi'.
5. Upset that Bollywood hasn't seen the film, Kangana lashes out at all the A-listers
Kangana has vowed to expose all the Bollywood celebrities. Speaking at a press conference, Kangana earlier said, &quot;Yeh meri kya madad karenge, yeh apne aap ko he promote kar le. I am 30 and have about 3-4 national awards. I don't want to work with them.&quot;
&ldquo;Is Rani of Jhansi my aunt? She’s as much mine as she’s yours. Then why are these people scared? They are worried just because I spoke on nepotism? They have all gathered together, like a classroom where 59 have ganged up against one, trying to bully one.
&ldquo;What Bollywood is doing, the planning and plotting, one thing is for sure, earlier I used to call them out for sexism, nepotism or pay disparity, but now I’ll be after them. ‘Inki vaat laga dugi’. I’ll expose each and every one. They have asked for trouble by ganging up against me,&rdquo; she added.
6. Kangana didn't spare Sonu Sood as well
Sonu Sood walked out Manikarnika mid way after reports of his scenes being chopped off went viral. Sonu, who was briefed differently earlier, decided to leave the film after Kangana took over the director's seat.
Lashing out at the actor, Kangana said, &quot;Sonu Sood is not allowed to talk about the project. He should not be speaking about the film as his contract was terminated. He doesn’t hold any sort of participation in the film. Why is he maligning the film? So, these people have deep rooted agendas,&quot; she said.
&quot;He vehemently denied to work under a woman director, which is kind of amusing because Sonu is a dear friend and I have even launched the music of a film that he produced at his request. Even though the team suggested that they have full faith in me, it seems, Sonu had neither dates nor faith,&quot; Kangana said in a statement.
7. Kangana was surprised that Uri gave a tough fight to Manikarnika
&quot;None of us expected the competition we got from Uri. It was another patriotic film that shared the same theme - fighting back for the nation. It was in its third week, but it still put up quite a tough fight,&quot; said Kangana in an interview.
Well, she might come across as a big motormouth but no one can deny this one thing - The rise and rise of Kangana Ranaut</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
