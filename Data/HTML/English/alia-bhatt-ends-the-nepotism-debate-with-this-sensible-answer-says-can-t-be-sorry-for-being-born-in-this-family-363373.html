Alia Bhatt Ends The Nepotism Debate With This Sensible Answer, Says ‘Can’t Be Sorry For Being Born In This Family'
The Nepotism debate was flagged by Bollywood queen Kangana Ranaut and it has not ended yet.

However Alia Bhatt’s sensible take on it might rest the debate once for and all.
She was asked about the ongoing nepotism debate once again to which she replied, &ldquo;Nepotism exists in every field. My thoughts on nepotism don't come from a negative place. If you know somebody from a certain field you will always help them.&rdquo;
Twitter
She even said that just because one is a star kid one cannot be lucky every time,
&ldquo;As I said, there are no negative thoughts. I can't wake up and say sorry for being born in this family. But I can definitely say that I will work as hard as possible to prove that I deserve to be here.&rdquo; The actress even confessed, &quot;But having said that, I am so in love with acting and being an actor, I would be devastated if I never got the opportunity.&quot;
Twitter
Clearly, Alia has won hearts with this reply. For quite a few days there have been many attacks from Kangana on Alia, but the latter chose to be calm and replied with her class.
