Both Farhan and Shibani post some of the most adorable pictures from their vacations and date nights and it has love written all over them.
Today, Farhan shared yet another picture of Shibani looking out of the balcony, with her dog. Captioning the picture as &quot;Looking out for each other&quot;, the picture summed up their lazy Sunday morning perfectly.
A few days before, there was a report that claimed how the couple is also interested in taking their relationship to the next level by tying the knot.
A source close to the couple spoke to DNA and said,
&quot;They are extremely serious about each other and Farhan's kids have also warmed up to Shibani, so this looks like the most obvious step for the two.&quot;
Shibani has been quizzed on her ambiguous relationship a lot of times but she has always maintained a dignified silence. She was quoted in a news report saying,
&quot;I don't need to make an announcement about who I'm dating. It's up to me to decide when and what I want to share about my personal life, and it is up to the audience to decide how they look at it. How much information I want to put out in the public domain is my prerogative.&quot;
Shibani and Farhan's relationship came to spotlight when she accompanied him for his Canada tour in 2018. Since then, they have been very comfortable with social media PDA and making public appearances together.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
