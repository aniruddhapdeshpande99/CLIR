Remember some time ago, a fan had pulled and dragged Nawazuddin Siddiqui by his neck in order to click a selfie with him? After the incident, Nawazuddin Siddiqui said that he needs to be careful with fans.
This time, a crazy Varun Dhawan fan first stalked him outside his home. She was taking rounds of the house when the guards spotted her. She wanted to meet Varun Dhawan.

However, since he is busy with Kalank promotions, he came home tired but the fan was in no mood to go home without meeting him. The situation got out of hands and she soon started shouting &ldquo;I will kill Natasha.&rdquo; The security guards had no option but to call the police.

&ldquo;She refused to leave and got into a squabble. Initially, she said she will hurt herself. When the security still didn't get her through to Varun sir, she threw a fit. She kept mumbling how she will harm Natasha ma'am,&rdquo; a source told Mid-day.

This isn’t the first time for Varun Dhawan. Earlier, a 17-year-old girl named Aditi Surana ran away from her home in Mumbai to catch a glimpse of her favourite actor in Mumbai during the time of Judwaa 2’s release.

Another time, a fan threatened that if he won’t reply to her, she would commit suicide. Varun had to file a police complaint in this regard.
