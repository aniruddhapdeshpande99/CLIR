We all work very hard to be worthy of our dough and being compared is deflating&quot;, Sobhita Dhulipala rattled when we asked her opinion on the comparisons Netizens are making after her hugely successful show Made In Heaven.
Where has she been hiding? - That's what a lot of people have been asking about Shobhita Dhulipala in the last week. And that's the precise issue - she hasn't been hiding - she was in the viral Durex ad with Ranveer Singh, Raman Raghav, Kaalakandi and even Chef, but it's Made In Heaven which has given her, her due. The general populace (or some of them) couldn't figure out how to slot her, so they've been quick to tag her the new Bipasha Basu (as dull as it sounds) considering she's not done a single horror movie, predictably, the word dusky has been mentioned.
Speaking candidly to the leggy lass in an exclusive interview, Sobhita Dhulipala talks about life before and after Made In Heaven. So here's to the woman of the moment.
I'm not sure if being called the new age Bipasha Basu should flatter me

The minute the trailer of Made In Heaven dropped, Internet started comparing Sobhita Dhulipala with Bipasha Basu. A lot of people confessed Sobhita took them back to Bipasha's Jism days with those intense eyes and brown skin. While Sobhita takes it in her stride, she's not sure if it's a compliment.
&quot;I am glad to hear that people are rooting for me - yay! But, I am my own person, and usage of this word - ‘dusky’ is strange and I don’t understand it. I would very much like for people to watch my character for what she is and acknowledge me as an actor for who I am - in all my merits and shortcomings.&quot;
It's not cakewalk for supermodels to crack Bollywood auditions and Sobhita is no different. Here's proof

For those who don't know, Sobhita was a supermodel with Kingfisher calendar and was also Miss India 2013. And if you thought that made her breakthrough in Bollywood easy, then you're mistaken. As per reports, during her first film audition, Sobhita had to perform an intimate scene with Vicky Kaushal which comes at the beginning of ‘Raman Raghav 2.0’. Though he was a total stranger and the surroundings were unfamiliar to her, Sobhita nailed it in a single take and got the part. Needless to say, Sobhita is a go-getter and Made In Heaven was always meant for her. Despite being in the industry for a couple of years, Sobhita auditioned for this one too.

&quot;I auditioned with the casting team and was called in for a look test a month later. I met Zoya Akhtar and Nitya Mehra there and was thrilled to learn of their support and that they were keen on me doing the part of Tara Khanna. A week later, I got the confirmation call and was delighted to be working with such a unique set of storytellers.&quot;
Sobhita feels before making choices between big banners or path breaking content, one should learn to be - unafraid.

She was not only a supermodel but like a typical South Indian family, a trained dancer in Bharatnatyam and Kuchipudi too. Sobhita has enjoyed challenges that have been thrown her way and her role in Made In Heaven as Mrs. Tara Khanna was no different. Asking if she deliberately chose a different path to stand out, she said, &quot;It has always been important to me to be part of content that moves me and is authentic. I don’t know if I chose the difficult path or not, I only remember being unafraid.&quot;
However, Sobhita admits &quot;despite playing a female lead in Raman Raghav 2.0, Kaalakaandi, Goodachari (Telugu) and Made In heaven, breaking into the mainstream is still hard.&quot;
After all, who doesn't enjoy a typical masala potboiler. Sobhita does too!
Twitter
It's difficult to imagine Sobhita fitting into a typical Dharma or a YRF film but it sure will be an interesting one. She looks forward to taking up such commercial cinema soon too. &quot;Why not? I want to be as amused by my choices as anybody else.&quot;
For many who think only Zoya Akhtar was involved with Made In Heaven, it had 3 more badass filmmakers directors - Nitya Mehra, Alankrita Shrivastava and Prashant Nair

When Kangana Ranaut shot Manikarnika, it got difficult for her to work under the guidelines of Krish, the one and only director of the film and she decided to take the reigns of the film in her own hands. But in Made In Heaven, there were 9 episodes shots by 4 different filmmakers. Although the cast kept changing, the four main leads continued to be the same. And strangely enough, the experience did not get nerve wracking for them. Wonder why!
&quot;All the 4 directors have a very strong sense of self - both as individuals and storytellers.&quot; Despite 4 directors for one show, Sobhita found it easy to mold herself accordingly, each time. &quot;I rely on my instincts as an artist and found this experience to be extremely gratifying and character building.&quot;
Tara Khanna is every middle class girl of 2019 - Unapologetic, fearless and the need of the hour
Even though, Tara Khanna was a fictional character, yet she managed to hit the chords with reality on a lot of levels. The reason why Made In Heaven is being the talk of the town is because from the Elitist to the service class, Tara Khanna is every woman of 2019 who is juggling between her personal hardships and braving on the professional forefront. She's ambitious yet vulnerable. She is every woman today.

Speaking extensively about her role, Sobhita divulged, &quot;A middle class girl who is now an industrialist’s wife - There’s a lot of aspiration, class struggle and inner turmoil. It was extremely joyous and delightful for to be playing a character with such depth and dilemmas. I thrive in playing parts that are more conflicted than I am.&quot;
Without batting an eye lid, she calls Tara Khanna's character 'gray'. &quot;Gray. As we all are. You, Me, everyone. Leaning towards darker and lighter as per our state of security.&quot;
Do such people love their spouse. Did Tara Khanna ever love Adil Khanna?
Twitter
Her character has a slice of both. Below middle class Tara claws her way to become the rich and powerful Tara Khanna by marrying her boss. Pondering back at the show, Sobhita feels her role did love her husband Jim Sarbh. &quot;Yes, her love may have been born out of certain conditions but it is love still,&quot; she thinks.
Sobhita may or may not have loved Adil, but her friendship with Karan (Arjun Mathur) and her roots remain intact. In the show, she does give us a flawless glimpse of her shocking urban poor accent from time to time.
Sobhita's role as Tara Khanna From Made In Heaven is over but she's coming back with lots more. Yes, Netflix too!
&quot;I’m doing a film with Rishi Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi Called The Body which is directed by Jeethu Joseph. Then there's Moothon with Nivin Pauly by Geetu Mohandas and a show for Netflix by Red Chillies. This is the release line up for 2019.&quot;

Before wrapping up, we couldn't resist but ask Sobhita about her personal favourite episode from the web show and she said, &quot;There isn’t one favourite but I like the episodes towards the latter half a little more. The emotional dynamics play out much more sharply. Most loved is the flashback portions for sure.&quot;

Well, we agree on that front too. And thank you Zoya Akhtar for showing through the realms of your show that the grass on the other side is green only because it's DARK.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
