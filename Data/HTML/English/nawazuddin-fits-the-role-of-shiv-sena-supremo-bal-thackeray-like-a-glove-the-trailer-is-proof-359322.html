Hours before the release, Thackeray was embroiled in a controversy. According to the makers of the movie, CBFC raised objections on four dialogues and two scenes and have asked them to make necessary changes.
&ldquo;Yes, they have raised objections on some dialogues and scenes, four dialogues and two scenes to be precise. We are legally dealing the matter with CBFC and we hope the matter will be sorted out soon,&quot; said Shiv Sena Parliamentarian and producer of the film Sanjay Raut.
Directed by Abhijit Panse, Thackeray is scheduled to be released on Jan 25, two days after the birth anniversary of late Bal Thackeray.
