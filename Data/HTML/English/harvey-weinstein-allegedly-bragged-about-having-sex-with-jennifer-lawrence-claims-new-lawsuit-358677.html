Weinstein also bragged about allegedly sleeping with Jennifer Lawrence and said that he was trying to help her and that he was the gateway to her dreams, according to the suit. In reference to the suit, Lawrence on Friday issued a statement denying that they had a sexual relationship.
&quot;My heart breaks for all the women who were victimised by Harvey Weinstein,&quot; Lawrence said. &quot;I have never had anything but a professional relationship with him. This is yet another example of the predatory tactics and lies that he engaged in to lure countless women.&quot;

The plaintiff said that she first met Weinstein at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013. She said she went to his suite, where Weinstein barged in on her while she was using the bathroom and pulled down his pants and masturbated, eventually ejaculating on her skirt.
Meanwhile, Weinstein' s attorney denied that he engaged in non-consensual sex, and alleged that his accusers are lying about consensual relations.
