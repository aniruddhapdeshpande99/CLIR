&quot;Before working on 'Gully Boy', I did some ads with Alia and they were really fun. She has lovely energy about her. But when I worked with her on 'Gully Boy', I realized what a powerhouse of a talent she is.&quot;
Ranveer is supremely fond of Alia Bhatt as he calls her &quot;immensely talented, expressive, full of emotion, very intelligent&quot; and that her emotional quotient is &quot;very high.&quot;

&quot;She has evolved as a person far beyond her years. She is on her way to greatness. She was really brilliant in 'Raazi'. I have been an admirer of her work and craft ever since 'Highway'.&quot;
Ranveer proudly says Alia &quot;could very well be the best part of 'Gully Boy'&quot;. He adds,
&quot;She plays the character, that on the script level, is my favourite character. She has really made it her own, and I'm very happy for her.&quot;
