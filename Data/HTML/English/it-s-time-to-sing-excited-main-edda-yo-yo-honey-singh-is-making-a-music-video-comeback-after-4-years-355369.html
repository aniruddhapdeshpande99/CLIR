From kids mugging up the lyrics of his songs to every club playing his hit songs, Yo Yo Honey Singh was a name that ruled the music industry a few years ago. But then, he suddenly went missing, leaving the show he was judging in the middle.
Nobody knows what happened to him. Rumours suggested that he was an alcoholic who had to be admitted into a rehab, but Honey Singh denied all such rumours.
Twitter
He has done a few songs in the past year including Dil Chori from Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety, which garnered 350 million views on YouTube, but unlike before, he didnâ€™t feature in the music video.
