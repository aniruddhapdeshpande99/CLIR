Overwhelmed by her big win, Dipika Kakar told IANS, &ldquo;I am on cloud nine. I thank my fans for making me win this show. Without their support, this would not have happened.&rdquo;
Furthermore, talking about her camaraderie with Sreesanth, she said, &ldquo;I never fought against him. I was very confident that Big Boss is about being you and I would be myself and that’s the reason why I have won the show. No doubt, bhai (Sreesanth) was my stronger competition but I never considered him as a foe and never felt that I have to win against him.&rdquo;
Dipika’s fans are quite happy that she won the show.
