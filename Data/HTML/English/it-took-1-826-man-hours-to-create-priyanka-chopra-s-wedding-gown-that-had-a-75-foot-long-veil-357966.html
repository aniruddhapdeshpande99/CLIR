It Took 1,826 Man Hours To Create Priyanka Chopra's Wedding Gown That Had A 75-foot Long Veil
To make a dreamy wedding come alive, it takes a team of experts who put in their best efforts and loads of hardwork. For Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' wedding, this challenge was a bigger one considering they belonged to two completely contrasting cultures.
Their wedding was not just a union of two souls in love but this brought together two cultures. The couple tied the knot in Jodhpur India and they had two wedding ceremonies-a Christian one and the second as per Hindu traditions.

The pictures of both these ceremonies were posted by People magazine and people had a collective meltdown. Be it PC's mother Madhu Chopra walking her down the aisle or Nick Jonas, wiping tears off after seeing the love of his life PC in the wedding gown, everything about these celebrations was adorable.

For their Christian ceremony, the couple chose Ralph Lauren. Just to jog your memory a little, PC and Nick Jonas met for the first time at MET Gala, where they were invited by Ralph Lauren.
After playing a passive cupid in their love-story, Ralph became an important part of their wedding as he offered to design PC's bridal outfit. The actress told People magazine,

&ldquo;For the Western wedding, we had been talking to a bunch of incredible designers, but ultimately when Ralph Lauren approached us, I learned that Ralph has only designed three wedding dresses in 50 years — one for his daughter, his daughter-in-law, and his niece,&rdquo; Chopra adds, adding, &ldquo;I was blown away.&rdquo;
PC further adds,
People Magazine
&ldquo;When we went in for the sketch presentation, they created exactly what I envisioned for myself on my wedding day… and I said, ‘Yes’ to the dress.&rdquo;
The brand claimed that to complete the embroidery of the outfit, it took the entire team close to 1,826 hours. It's not just PC who is impressed. Priyanka's friend and stylist Mimi Cuttrell too gushed over the design and said,
&ldquo;I would not have changed a thing about this dress. The Ralph Lauren team was an incredible team to work with. It was such a fun collaborative process between Priyanka, Ralph Lauren, and myself. Seeing this dress come to life and walk down the aisle… it still gives me chills!&quot;
After returning from Jodhpur, wedding festivities continue for Nick and Priyanka, who are currently in Delhi.
