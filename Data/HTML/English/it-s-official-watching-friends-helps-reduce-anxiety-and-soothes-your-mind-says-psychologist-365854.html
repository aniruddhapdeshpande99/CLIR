&ldquo;Having worked for over a period of 20 years with those experiencing anxiety, I can conclude that among other factors, it is the repetitive and relational nature of programs such as Friends and Big Bang Theory that will be doing the trick,&rdquo; said linical psychologist, Marc Hekster as quoted by the Metro.

He added that characters’ problems in show provide comfort as well as sense of escapism to people.
&ldquo;[Watching Friends] is about an experience of repair, of watching the characters in the show repeatedly having worries, which then get repaired and soothed, usually in the context of other relationships in their lives. Complex problems are made the focus of each episode, and then they are resolved within the relationships which are the essence of the shows. It is pure escapism - excellent, bring it on,&rdquo; he added.

Furthermore, he explained, &ldquo;Yes, it is soothing to see the same outcome every time and know you can depend on it. This is at the heart of human development. So, when grown-ups are anxious, they can have child-like feelings of fear and worry, and these can be soothed by repetition.&rdquo;
So, it’s time to binge watch all seasons of FRIENDS for 138564930th time?
