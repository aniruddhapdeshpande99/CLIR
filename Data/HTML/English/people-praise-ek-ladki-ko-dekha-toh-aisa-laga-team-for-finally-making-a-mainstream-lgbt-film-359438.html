Well, we have seen over a million films revolving around the idea of love and how the characters struggle to find their happy ending but this time, there is something different that deserves our attention.
We have seen some brave films touching the topic of homosexuality but never in Bollywood did we see a mainstream film doing justice to it. Well, the change we wanted to see is finally here.
The trailer of Sonam Kapoor-Anil Kapoor-Rajkummar Rao-Juhi Chawla starrer 'Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laha' was out yesterday and people are overwhelmed.
In a first, we will see a family drama that will revolve around the topic that many filmmakers are scared of even touching.

The trailer showcases Sonam Kapoor as a typical Indian girl who dreams of &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo;.
However, after many twists and turns in her arranged marriage proposals, she finally is seen talking about her 'secret' that she is afraid of sharing.
As soon as the trailer was out, people started raving the team for touching the topic. The team was applauded and especially Sonam Kapoor, who has become one of the first few actresses who chose to experiment and take up a subject that many mainstream actors would have not taken up.
