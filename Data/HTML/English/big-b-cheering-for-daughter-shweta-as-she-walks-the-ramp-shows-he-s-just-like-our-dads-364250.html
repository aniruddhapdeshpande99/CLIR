But what's winning our hearts is how Big B was the most adorable Daddy! Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan were sitting at the front row as they cheered for their daughter Shweta who sported two ensembles - a bridal lehenga and a trademark Abu Sandeep chikankari creation for the ramp show. Have a look at the pictures and videos right here.
Just like any other father, Big B had his phone out and recorded the entire show while Shweta made them proud. After the show, Big B also posted an adorable message for Shweta. He took to Twitter to write:
