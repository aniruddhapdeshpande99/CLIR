Kim Kardashian is studying to become a lawyer? Wow honestly didn't expect that, but given who her father was and her slight interest in prison reform, it's not too surprising. If she's serious about this then s/o to her I can fw that. — taylor 🌙 (@quattlestrology) April 10, 2019
Apparently, Kim Kardashian doesn't need a college degree or law school to take the bar exam in California. If you're privileged and complete an apprenticeship with a lawyer or a law firm, you can do whatever you want. Ain't that a blimp. — FERRARI SHEPPARD (@stopbeingfamous) April 11, 2019
