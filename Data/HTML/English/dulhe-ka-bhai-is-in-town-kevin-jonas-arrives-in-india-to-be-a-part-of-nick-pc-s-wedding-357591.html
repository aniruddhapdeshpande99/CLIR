Wedding are supposed to be private affair, people! So, just like Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, grapevine suggests that Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have also banned mobile phones at their wedding. What’s more? The paps won’t be able to bring you the pictures, because the bride and groom will arrive at their wedding destination in a chopper. So, we doubt if any pictures would leak. However, one can be hopeful, right?
