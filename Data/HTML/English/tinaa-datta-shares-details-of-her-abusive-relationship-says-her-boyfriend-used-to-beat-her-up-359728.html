And looks like, it's not going to die down anytime soon. But this was a harassment of a different nature. TV actress Tinaa Datta spoke to Bombay Times and opened up about her abusive relationship.
Speaking to Bombay times Tinaa said, &quot;I was in a relationship with a non-industry guy for five years. We had met through common friends. But I called time on it, because he was extremely abusive, verbally and physically. I would get bashed up even in front of my friends.

The actress who was always looking to settle down in a love marriage set up was shocked something like this could happen to her. But it did and she dealt with it for five long years.
&quot;I went bonkers to an extent that my confidence took a beating. I never wanted to go public with my relationship, but I feel that it’s time to speak up,&rdquo; added Tinaa.
Despite dating a non-industry guy, Tinaa shares she still wants to settle down with someone who is not from the industry. Speaking with the daily, Tinaa says, &quot;I want to settle down and not go about having affairs and then nursing heartbreaks. I have always wanted a love marriage, but God is not sending anyone my way. I don’t want to marry someone from the industry, especially an actor, as the relationship will be marred by insecurities. I have seen several failed marriages between actors.&quot;
More power to Tinaa and hope she has a spectacular 2019.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
