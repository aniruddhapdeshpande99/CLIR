And this time, the actor will dress up as female characters like Sita, Draupadi and Radha.
&quot;I can't reveal much about the film but the title fairly reveals the story. What I can tell you is that Ayushmann becomes Sita from Ramayana, Draupadi from Mahabharata and Radha from Krishna Leela. Now why he becomes them and how, that's what the story is about,&quot; director of the film, Raaj Shaandilyaa told.

&quot;Ayushmann is a very simple, sincere actor. There's no ego or attitude in him. He works like it's his first film. When an actor is so flexible and giving, it immensely helps the film. Working with him is like making one of the most wonderful films of your life,&quot; he said.
Starting his career in 2006, Shaandilyaa has written around 600 scripts for comics. Writing for comedy shows came in handy for 'Dream Girl', the director said. The film, produced by Ekta Kapoor, is slated to be released in September.
