&ldquo;I think it’s a great and wonderful script. I am a huge fan of Rakesh (Sharma) and it’s a wonderful story. I feel sad that I am not able to do it, which is why I actually called up Shah Rukh and said that it’s a wonderful story and you should hear it’. I am really happy that he liked it and he is doing it so, all my best wishes for their project.&rdquo;
