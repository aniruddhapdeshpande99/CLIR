The poll body said that delaying the release will be in the interest of free and fair Lok Sabha elections. EC on Monday submitted its report in a sealed cover before the Supreme Court over the film following which a bench headed by Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, posted the matter for hearing on April 26 and had directed that report be served to the petitioner (producers of the movie).

The top court had asked the EC to watch the Narendra Modi biopic and submit its view to the court by April 22 in a sealed cover.
On April 12, makers of the Oberoi-starrer had moved the apex court, challenging the stay on the film's release. The producer of the film, Sandip Singh, had said that the poll panel banned the movie without watching it.
The film was scheduled to release on April 11, coinciding with the commencement of the Lok Sabha elections in the country. However, on April 10, the EC stayed the release of the biopic till national elections culminate, stating that the film disturbs the level-playing field.
