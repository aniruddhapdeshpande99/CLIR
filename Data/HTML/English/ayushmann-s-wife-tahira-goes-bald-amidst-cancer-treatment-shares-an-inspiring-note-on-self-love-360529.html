Tahira was diagnosed with breast cancer and is going through the preventive mastectomy, has gone bald.
She took to her social media to share photographs of her &quot;new&quot; self. She captioned the pictures as,
&quot;Hello, world! That's a new me with the old self! Was getting tired of the extensions. Well, this is how it is and it's so liberating, so much so that I don't have to duck the shower while bathing or while picking up the soap! Never thought I had to go bald, but this feels good.&quot;
Like a supporting and loving husband that Ayushmann is, he left an adorable comment on the picture. He wrote, 'Hottie', proving that his love for her is beyond everything in life.

Just to jog your memory a little, on September 22 last year, Tahira shared online that she was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in her right breast with high-grade malignant cells.
However, she returned to work after mastectomy in November.
