Most of his recent films have a valid mix of both patriotism and nationalism.
After back to back hits including Madras Cafe Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran, Satyameva Jayate, he is currently gearing up for the release of RAW - Romeo Akbar Walter and Batla House.
Talking to ZoomTV.com, John explained why he is choosing such films. He said,
&ldquo;It's by default, and not by design. If there's a sense of patriotism, I am happy.&quot;
He also added that while other countries glorify their soldiers on celluloid, Indians too should exploit this choice and make similar films. He added,

&ldquo;I think America does it with great success... When they do a Lone Survivor, when they do any American war film. We as Indians, when we watch an American film we think to ourselves, Oh man, I want to be a part of the American army. Literally. If they can glorify their soldiers, government and country so much, why can't we do the same for our country in the best possible way that our youngsters want to see our country. And films like RAW are an answer to that, where you come out and say &ldquo;Hell, it's so cool to be an agent but it is tough and this is what you have to do, it is crazy.&quot;
Talking about the transition that John has seen, he added that he's seen people be embarrassed about being Indian but thankfully, things are changing and for the better. He added,
&ldquo;I think we are doing a good job in making that change now... I see nothing wrong with the sense of Indianness that's happening in our country. And I come from a generation where I have seen people turn the Indian passport because they were embarrassed to say they were Indian. Today, that same person would turn it back.&rdquo;
Starring Mouni Roy, Jackie Shroff and Sikandar Kher in lead roles, John Abraham's RAW has been inspired by true events from the 1971 Indo-Pak war and is all set to hit the theaters this Friday.
