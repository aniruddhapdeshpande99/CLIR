For starters, while everyone thought Roma would win the best picture awards, it rather went into Green Book‚Äôs kitty. We all expected Bohemian Rhapsody would take the least number of awards back home, but they claimed the most. The team took back home four trophies. Not Bradley Cooper but Rami Malek won leading actor‚Äôs award. What‚Äôs more? The Favourite, which secured most number (ten) of nominations, only won one award.
Here are some of the moments from Oscars 2019 that everyone‚Äôs talking about. Take a look!
#1 Lady Gaga fixed Rami Malek‚Äôs bow tie before they settled into their seats at Dolby Theatre, and it was damn cute!

&ldquo;We made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life just unapologetically himself. The fact that I'm celebrating him and this story with you tonight is proof that we're longing for stories like this. I am the son of immigrants from Egypt. I am a first generation American, and part of my story is being written right now and I could not be more grateful.&rdquo;

#15 The Best actress award was a shocker!
Olivia Colman won the leading actress award for The Favourite. Why was it surprising? Because everyone thought Glenn Close would be winning it. Olivia Colman was the sole representative from the movie. Perhaps, even she didn't see this coming. &quot;It's genuinely quite stressful. This is hilarious, got an Oscar,&quot; she said as she collected her trophy. &quot;Glenn Close, you've been my idol for so long and this is not how I wanted it to be... I think you're amazing, I love you very much.&quot;
