&ldquo;My father also never said that this is your second mother… I think Kareena would have a nervous breakdown if I was to call her 'choti maa'&rdquo;
#2 She shined with her savage sense of humour as she poked fun at her parent's divorce.
&ldquo;I already said Happy Independence Day&rdquo;, she said revealing the first episode of the show was recorded on Aug 16, 2004, one day after Amrita Singh &ldquo;threw&rdquo; Saif &ldquo;out of the house&rdquo;.
#3 Sara is happy that their parents are now happy!
Twitter
&ldquo;I feel that it's very important to respect what other people want. I see my father today and I see my mother today and they are both much happier than I think they would have been together. And therefore everybody around them is happier. And I think what I have now is two very comfortable homes as oppose to one very uncomfortable home. I really think that I win.&rdquo;
#4 She remembers how her mother Amrita Arora dressed her up for father Saif’s wedding with Kareena.

&ldquo;My mom dressed me for my father’s wedding. A lot of people would be of the opinion that Kareena was being weird or mom was being weird. It was very comfortable. Everyone was so mature. It was not a big deal.&rdquo;
#5 Saif revealed he wrote a note to Amrita Singh before getting married to Kareena.
&ldquo;When I was getting married to Kareena, for some reason, I wrote a note to Amrita saying this is a new chapter starting. I wrote we had a history and something on the lines of good wishes for both of us. I sent it to Kareena to take a look. I sent it across. Sara called me and said, ‘I was coming anyway but now, I am coming with a happy heart.’ I think that story sums up the attitude of everyone involved.&rdquo;
#6 Saif made things awkward for Sara as he revealed how he checks out Kareena in her gym look.
Does he check her out before she goes out? &ldquo;Of course, coming and going,&rdquo; he said.
#7 Saif also revealed paps get Rs 1500 bucks for one photo of Taimur Ali Khan.
#8 &ldquo;Got cash, take her&rdquo;, Saif cracked this joke quite a lot of times on the show.
#9 Sara insisted that her love life shall not be like her parents.
&ldquo;You can’t control people. Hopefully she’ll have the values that we have, and find her own way,&rdquo; Saif said, to which Sara interrupted, &ldquo;Not all the values that all of you have had… I think my father and mother were quite wild. I think I’m less wild than them… I think my mother has done some wild stuff.&rdquo;
