Now filmmaker Sajid Khan on Friday said he is stepping down as director of &quot;Housefull 4&quot; amid allegations the he indulged in sexual misconduct with multiple women.
In response, Sajid wrote on Twitter: &quot;In the wake of the allegations against me and the pressure being put on my family, my producer and the stars of my film 'Houseful4', I must take the moral responsibility of stepping down from my directorial post, till the time I can allay the allegations and prove the truth... I request my friends in the media to kindly not pass judgment till the truth is out.&quot;
The film Housefull 4 also features Nana Patekar, who too is accused of sexual misconduct by actress Tanushree Dutta.
Akshay Kumar, the star of &quot;Housefull 4&quot;, has called off the film's shooting until &quot;further investigation&quot;.
His wife Twinkle Khanna too took to Twitter to take a firm stance on the filming of the movie.
Appalled hearing multiple incidents of harassment and it is truly horrific to hear what these women have been through. Everyone involved in Housefull needs to take a firm stance on this issue. This cannot go on. â€” Twinkle Khanna (@mrsfunnybones) October 12, 2018
We're yet to see the fate of the film, if it will release anytime soon.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
