After A Really Long Wait, Here Are The First Pics Of Newlyweds Ranveer Singh & Deepika Padukone!
Even a million reasons to gush over them are not enough. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone tied the knot as per Sindhi rituals today. On Wednesday, the couple married in a traditional Konkani ceremony in Italy’s Lake Como.
Unlike other celebrity weddings that are turned into live hashtagged events, this one was phenomenal too, but for various other reasons. The couple took some special measures to protect their privacy.
