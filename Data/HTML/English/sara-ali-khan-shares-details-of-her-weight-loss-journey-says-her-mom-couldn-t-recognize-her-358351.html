She had her own share of challenges and her weight was a major one. In an interview with SpotboyE, she recalled how she went crying to her mother Amrita. She told her mom how she wants to become an actor. But Sara, who was dealing with weight gain and obesity was told by her mother to shed the extra weight.
It was during the last year of her college that she decided to work out and lose weight. She didn't just refrain from FaceTiming her mother, but she spent a large part of her day 'working out'. She returned to India after losing 30 kgs. She said,
&ldquo;She recognized me at the airport only because of my suitcases; I was looking completely different.&quot;
Sara says it took her a year-and-a-half to lose the weight, which sheâ€™d gained after enrolling in university. She said,
&ldquo;It took me about a year-and-half to lose that weight. So, I completed the remaining two years of my graduation in a year so that I can return and start working early. I was always a chubby girl, but after going to the States, for the first two years, I put on a lot of weight and then last year, I burned all those kilos there itself.&quot;
She further added how America is a land of contrasts but you always have an option of making the right choices. She added,
&ldquo;Jahaan aapko pizza milta hain, wahin aapko protein milta hain. Jahaan pe chocolate milta hain, wahin aapko salad milta hain (On one hand you could eat a pizza and on the other, you could have protein, on one hand, you could get chocolate and on the other, you could eat salad). That was it. So, I lost all the weight that I had gained there and lots more by working out and maintaining a disciplined life.&quot;
Sara is currently promoting her next film Simmba.
Starring Ranveer singh, Simmba is helmed by Rohit Shetty is all set for a pan India release on 28th December.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
