The story of the fan named Cyrille is going viral on social media. He warned his girlfriend, Kamilla Rose, not to ruin his cinematic experience by taking popcorn or toilet breaks while watching the film.
Kamilla posted a screenshot of her boyfriend‚Äôs ‚Äòlist‚Äô on Twitter. The list reads: &ldquo;We will not be queuing to buy popcorn, please make prior arrangements. You are not permitted to consume and food during the film (including end credits)... I will not be moving to allow you to pass for a toilet break - find an alternative rule.&rdquo;

It further said, &ldquo;In case of any emergency relating to our son, I give you full authority to leave and take control. I will join you after the film (inc end credits) ends.&rdquo; The list also mentioned they will have a 30-minute debrief session and another &ldquo;period of self reflection&rdquo;.
She was also asked not to communicate with him during the trailers or duration of the film. Reacting to such rules, Kamilla tweeted: &ldquo;My boyfriend sent me a very sternly worded note about our cinema trip to see ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame‚Äô. Mad because I thought it was just date night.&rdquo;As the tweet went viral, many Avengers fans supported the boyfriend and found him &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;justified&rdquo;.
