So, Aamir went to the right person who could guide him, and that person was none other than Shah Rukh Khan. SRK has done a couple of films with the megastar and so his buddy Aamir decided to seek his advice.
In an interaction with us, Aamir revealed he had gone to meet SRK only to ask whether he smokes in front of Amitabh Bachchan or not and his answer and advice to him was hilarious.

Aamir narrates, &quot;I smoke, but I was worried if I can smoke in front of Amit ji, so I decided to meet Shah Rukh, I went to meet him and asked , ‘Shah, Do you smoke in front of Amit ji?’. He said, ‘ Yes, there is no problem, I smoke in front of him.’ I asked him, &ldquo;Did you ever asked him, ‘he is like, No, but he hasn’t stopped me ever’, I questioned him, what if he tells me anything on smoking. He then suggested, &ldquo; Pehli din tu thodha door se pee, uske baad thodha thodha nazdik jaa, go smoothly&rdquo;.

Aamir even revealed how this conversation between him and SRK reached to Amit ji, thanks to photographer Avinash Govarikar,
&ldquo;One day after shooting in Malta I went to Amit ji and asked him if we can go and watch a movie together. While walking towards the theatre, he said, &ldquo; Aamir, I heard you went to Shah Rukh and asked whether you can smoke in front of me&rdquo;. I said, ‘Who told you this?’. He said, Avinash, I immediately asked, ‘Sir, what’s your answer’, he said, ‘ you can smoke in front of me, but it’s not good for your health’. I then asked him, sir, you smoke? He said, ‘Yes, I do’ &rdquo;.
Could it get more hilarious than this?
