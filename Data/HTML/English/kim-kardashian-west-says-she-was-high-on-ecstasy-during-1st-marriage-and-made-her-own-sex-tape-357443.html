But that was not all, she also said, &quot;I did ecstasy once and I got married. I did it again, I made a sex tape. Like, everything bad would happen.&quot;
In 2007, a sex tape featuring Kim and American singer Ray J went viral and made Kim famous. The revelation took both Disick and Jenner by surprise. &quot;I just can't believe that was you,&quot; Jenner said.
