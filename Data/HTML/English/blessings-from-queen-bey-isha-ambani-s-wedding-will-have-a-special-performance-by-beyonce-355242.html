Keep your expectations higher than ever because it is the daughter of the richest man in India, Mukesh Ambani who is getting married soon. Isha Ambani is all set to tie the knot with Anand Piramal. A few months ago, the lavish engagement ceremony of the duo took place in Italy’s Lake Como, the same place where Deepika and Ranveer are rumoured to be tying the knot in Nov.

&ldquo;Isha is a big fan of American singer Beyoncé which is why Mukesh Ambani decided to have the pop star perform at the Sangeet ceremony. Both Anand and Isha are super excited to have the celebrated singer perform at their wedding. Some of Bollywood stars will also be doing a special performance at Isha’s cocktail in Udaipur,&rdquo; Filmfare quoted a source as saying.
Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal’s festivities are scheduled to take place on December 8 and 9. The couple will tie the knot on December 10 in Udaipur. Well, if Beyonce arrives in India to perform for the Amabanis, it is going to be one heck of a night, don’t you think?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
