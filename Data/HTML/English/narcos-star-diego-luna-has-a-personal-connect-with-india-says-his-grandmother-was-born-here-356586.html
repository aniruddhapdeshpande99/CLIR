&ldquo;I find so many similarities between the Indian culture and the Mexican culture... There is so much in common. The contrast you live when you go out and the richness in terms of cultural diversity is amazing. It feels like you are from here. I think this is why you would love 'Narcos: Mexico,&rdquo; he said in Mumbai where he and his co-star Michael Pena and showrunner Eric Newman joined Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt and director Shakun Batra to talk on the show.
