Claiming the responsibility for the brutal act was Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group. The car that rammed a CRPF bus was driven by terrorist Aadil Ahmad AKA Adil Ahmad Gaadi Takranewala AKA Waqas Commando of Gundibagh.
Right before the deadly attack, he said in a video that surfaced later on, &ldquo;My name is Adil, I joined the Jaish e Mohammad a year ago. After a year's wait, I have got the chance to do what I joined the Jaish for... By the time this video reaches you, I will be in heaven... this is my last message for the people of Kashmir.&rdquo;
