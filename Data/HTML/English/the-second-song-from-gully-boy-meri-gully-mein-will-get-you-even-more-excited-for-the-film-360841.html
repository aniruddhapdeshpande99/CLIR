The Second Song From Gully Boy 'Meri Gully Mein' Will Get You Even More Excited For The Film
If there is one film that has managed to create a lot of buzz this year, it is Gully Boy.
Helmed by Zoya Akhtar, the film brings together two of the most powerful stars we have today-Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh. Be it the trailer or the first track, people are loving the energy, the vibe and the fact that Ranveer Singh once again will be seen in a compelling and new avatar.
Today, the second song from the film, titled Meri Gully Mein was released and it is a remix of Divine and Naezy’s breakout single of the same name.
For the uninitiated, the film will revolve around the lives of the rappers who became insanely popular after their DIY-style music video for Meri Gully Mein made them and their ‘gully rap’ popular.
