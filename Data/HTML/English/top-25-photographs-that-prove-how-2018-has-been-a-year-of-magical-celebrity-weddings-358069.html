As an outsider, we can only imagine and think of how these stars live. How big are their houses? How grand are their cars? While the luxurious lives of these celebrities always appeal to us, commoners, there's much more to these celebrities that we are unaware about.
We heavily rely on what we see and how these stars conduct themselves publicly, what we don't see is how real their emotions are! They too fall in love, have their share of heartbreaks, fall in love with their co-stars and have their share of personal and purely private love-stories.
2018 has been a year when many of these love-stories took a beautiful turn in the form of marriage. Three leading ladies of Bollywood and women who have always taken a stand for feminism and equality took the plunge and registered themselves in the married actresses club!
In May, Sonam Kapoor got hitched with her longtime boyfriend Anand Ahuja. This was followed by a special winter wedding in November for love-birds Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone and we close this year by a very special cross-culture wedding of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas. A year of happy endings INDEED! Here's a quick flashback of 2018 where we picked our favorite moments from these celebrity weddings. Have a look!

1. Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja
Everything was indeed 'phenomenal' about this wedding. Lovebirds Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja dated for three years before finally taking the plunge. It was a big-fat Punjabi wedding with both families coming together for this special union of love.
It wasn't just one of the most 'popular' events of the year on the internet but it made us collectively gush.

3. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone
If we ever take a poll on Bollywood's most special love story, a lot of people will vote in favor of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone. From being co-stars to falling in love on the sets of their film to making their rock solid relationship last for six years, DeepVeer have continued to give some serious relationship goals for years now. Away from media spotlight, the couple flew down to Italy and got hitched at Lake Como, amidst their favorite set of people. After coming back to India, they hosted two wedding receptions, in one Bengaluru and two in Mumbai for their media family and fraternity friends.
