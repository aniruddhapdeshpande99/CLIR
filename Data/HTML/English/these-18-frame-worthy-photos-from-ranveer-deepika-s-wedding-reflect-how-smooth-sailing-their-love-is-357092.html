It was a wedding that wasn't just lavish and 'extra' in terms of set up and arrangements but from their emotions to their love, everything was so extra that you can't help but gush over them.
We have seen them making a public appearance a lot of times but the pictures from the ceremony are so full of love and joy that you feel like you're a part of their love story too. There wasn't anything pretentious about them. The wedding must have taken place in Italy but everything was Desi - right from the ceremonies to the photographs that were shared on social media.
