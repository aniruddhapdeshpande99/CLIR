With Snow Suites & Ice Bars, This Game Of Thrones Inspired Hotel Is Literally The Coolest Place To Stay At!
If you want to marry in a King’s style, this Game of Thrones hotel is here to make your dreams come true. In this hotel made up of ice and snow, you will get to see the Night King as well. What’s more? There’s Great Sept of Baelor as well -- the center of religious worship for the Faith of the Seven and the seat of the High Septon of the Faith at King’s Landing where Joffrey Baratheon’s extravagant wedding took place.
We know King Joffrey Baratheon was poisoned at his own wedding. That’s apparently what the Purple wedding from Game of Thrones is popular for. But you’ll have to agree that it was an extravagant affair that made most of us jealous, right?
If you and your loved one are obsessing over Game Of Thrones and are planning to get married too, what could be better than this, right?

If you are looking for more details, this Game of Thrones hotel has opened in Finland for the second time. Ardent GoT fans must have heard of it before. It had first opened in 2018.
The Hotel is called The Snow Village Lapland Hotel and is situated 120 miles above the Arctic Circle. It is all made up of ice and snow. It will make you feel like you are at the Game of Thrones sets.
The rooms are kept at a temperature of -2 to -5 degrees Celsius. That is apparently one of the reasons why the hotel recommends you spend only a single night in the suites and then shift to a regular room.
There’s ice restaurant, ice bar, and a dragon ice slide too. Snow Village will be open until April 8.
How much will it cost? The standard double rooms will cost you about Rs 19,000, while the snow suites will cost about ₹25,400. Time to pack your bags? Beware of the White Walkers, fellas!</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
