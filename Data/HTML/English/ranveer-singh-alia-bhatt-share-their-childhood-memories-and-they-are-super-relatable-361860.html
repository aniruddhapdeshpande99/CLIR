&quot;I think I was in Class 3 or 4 when I first got into hip-hop. I loved listening to Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G, while growing up and I have been into that kind of music ever since. I used to watch a lot of MTV and that's where I first experienced it. There is a cousin of mine who migrated to the US and whenever he used to come down for summer holidays, he used to bring this music and we used to sit and hear it all the time,&quot; Ranveer had earlier told IANS.
