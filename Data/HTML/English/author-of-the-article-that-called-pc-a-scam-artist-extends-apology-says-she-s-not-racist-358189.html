People Magazine
Extending the apology, they had written: &quot;An earlier story about Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas did not meet our standards. We've removed it and apologize.&quot;
The author of the article received a lot of backlash for her story.
Yo, Mariah Smith had the absolute gall to write about Priyanka being a scammer with a Spon-Con wedding when she herself got a whole-ass birthday party paid for by brands.ðŸ˜‚https://t.co/Ki9zkKtcul â€” Bennett D. 'Approachably Cool' Bennett (@TheAcecapade) December 5, 2018
What a sad way to make a living. Good luck, Mariah Smith. Wishing this story millions of ðŸ‘€ so that you get your Cut. #Vicioushttps://t.co/hVXWmXmpt6 â€” Twerk Gotra (@ippusultan) December 5, 2018
I can credit The Cut and Mariah Smith's bullshit hot take with one thing: They moved me from being on the fence about Nick and Priyanka to vowing to defend them to the death. pic.twitter.com/FjLb7nPnH9 â€” Suleikha Snyder (@suleikhasnyder) December 5, 2018

Mariah Smith, it was offensive! You should know better and you know youâ€™re better than that. What you wrote is totally beyond! I feel the BITTERNESS in each word you put in it! Youâ€™re unbelievable! â€” Ushi Sato (@UshiSato) December 5, 2018
The backlash against The Cut and Mariah Smithâ€™s trash garbage article is well deserved. She absolutely should have known better. Its baffles me that she even thought it would be okay to write something so offensive & degrading. Mariah, herself, owes Priyanka an apology too. pic.twitter.com/sWOevuSxWi â€” Jackson (@lawanddesign) December 6, 2018
And now, the author of the article, Mariah Smith, too has taken the full responsibility and apologized for her words.
