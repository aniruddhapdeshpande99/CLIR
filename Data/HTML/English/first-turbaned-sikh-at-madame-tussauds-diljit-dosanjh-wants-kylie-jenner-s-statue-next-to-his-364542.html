As Diljit Dosanjh unveiled his Madame Tussauds’ wax figure in Delhi yesterday, he became the first turbaned Sikh celebrity to get this honour. A die-hard fan of Kylie Jenner, Diljit says he wants Kylie Jenner’s statue next to his. When asked which actress’ statue he would like to have next to him, he laughed and said, &ldquo;Kylie Jenner.&rdquo;
For the uninitiated, Diljit Dosanjh is such a big fan of Kylie Jenner that he often comments on her instagram pictures. So much so, that once during a live chat video of Kim Kardarshian, her cousin, he even asked, &ldquo;Kylie Kithe Aa&rdquo;.
Don't Miss 12.5 K SHARES 5.5 K SHARES 3.4 K SHARES 3.1 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES
It started with usual greetings.
And then he posed the main question.
But Kim wasn’t replying.
And when Kylie posted a picture with her boyfriend, he even wrote this.
And when she announced that she was pregnant, Diljit Dosanjh was heartbroken.
