Just recently, Irrfan Khan was spotted at the Mumbai airport by the paps. He was hiding his face because reportedly he didn’t wish to be clicked. If reports are to be believed, he had returned to India last month.

Back in March last year, Irrfan had revealed that he has been diagnosed with a rare tumour. Soon after, he went to London for treatment.
&quot;The unexpected makes us grow, which is what the past few days have been about. Learning that I have been diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumour as of now has admittedly been difficult, but the love and strength of those around me and that I found within me has brought me to a place of hope,&quot; Irrfan earlier said while sharing the news of his tumour.
Be it the sequel to his 2017 film Hindi Medium, or another film, we just hope we see the 52-year-old actor on the big screen soon. Here's wishing him good luck.
