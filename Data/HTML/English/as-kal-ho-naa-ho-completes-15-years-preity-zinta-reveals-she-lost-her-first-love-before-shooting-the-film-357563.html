As ‘Kal Ho Naa Ho’ Completes 15 Years, Preity Zinta Reveals She Lost Her First Love Before Shooting The Film
&ldquo;Aaj ek hassi aur baant lo, aaj ek dua aur maang lo, aaj ek ansoon aur pee lo, aaj ek zindagi aur jee lo, aaj ek sapna aur dekh lo, aaj … kya pata, kal ho naa ho…&rdquo;
This dialogue from Kal Ho Naa Ho is enough to give us the feels. We all have shed tears while watching the movie that taught us the harsh reality of life, love, friendship and family.

Did you know that Kal Ho Naa Ho was first offered to Kareena Kapoor, but she rejected it, and later it fell into Preity Zinta’s kitty?
Remembering the good old days, Preity Zinta says some of the best things happened to her during the movie.
&ldquo;It was very special to me because I lost my first love. I was in love with him, he was not. I felt strongly when the film was offered to me. Some of the best things have happened to me during that film,&rdquo; she told PTI.

The film revolved around a young, introvert woman, who has trust issues after her father's suicide. Eventually, she falls in love but that is not meant to be.
&quot;It was one of those films that filled me with joy but it broke our hearts as well. It was a roller coaster ride... It is a timeless film. I am fortunate that I was a part of it,&quot; Preity said.
Twitter
Preity had turned down Jab We Met but has no regrets about the film, which is considered a modern romantic classic. Preity said she and Kareena have a &quot;karmic connection&quot;.
&quot;There is a karmic connection between Kareena and me. We both are in very good karma with each other because she said no to Kal Ho Na Ho' and I said no to Jab We Met', both of them are iconic and career defining films. People tell me they liked me a lot in Kal Ho Na Ho' and I think she did a wonderful job as Geet,&quot; she said.
