18 Times Twinkle Khanna-Akshay Kumar Proved Marriage Is All About Love & Trolling Each Other
She is MrsFunnyBones and he for sure knows how to tickle ours. Well, Mr. and Mrs. K are perfect in every sense of the word. They are funny, adorable and mostly on the same page (and sometimes the same holiday boat too).
Today, Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna have completed 18 years of a blissful marriage and like always, she had the wittiest take on their marriage. Once Akshay had even revealed the details of their first meeting. He had said,
&quot;I met Twinkle for the first time during a photo session with Jayesh Seth for Filmfare. I still have that photograph. We were already impressed with each other. So I never had to do anything to impress her. Hiring goons and staging a fight or pretending to jump off a hill ‚Äî I didn‚Äòt need to do all that.&quot;
When they made an appearance together on Koffee With Karan, they revealed that before going to bed, they make sure they play 10 rounds of rummy. Twinkle said,
Don't Miss 814 SHARES 1.2 K SHARES 18.3 K SHARES 9.8 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES
&quot;Every night before going to bed, we play 10 rounds of rummy for enormous amounts of money. At the moment, I owe him some 4.5 Lakhs.&quot;
Today as they complete yet another benchmark in their marital life, let's look back at all those times when they proved that they are each other's biggest trolls and strength.
