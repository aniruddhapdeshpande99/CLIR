According to the entertainment portal, here’s the first look from Game of Thrones season 8.
Revealing the plot details of Game of Thrones season 8, EW reported:
&ldquo;Season 8 opens at Winterfell with an episode that contains plenty of callbacks to the show’s pilot. Instead of King Robert’s procession arriving, it’s Daenerys and her army. What follows is a thrilling and tense intermingling of characters—some of whom have never previously met, many who have messy histories—as they all prepare to face the inevitable invasion of the Army of the Dead.&rdquo;

What’s more? The report further claims that Sansa Stark isn’t quite pleased about brother Jon Snow kneeling before Daenarys Targaryen. Bryan Cogman has confirmed the same in a statement given to the portal.
&ldquo;It's about all of these disparate characters coming together to face a common enemy, dealing with their own past, and defining the person they want to be in the face of certain death. It's an incredibly emotional, haunting, bittersweet final season and I think it honours very much what [author George RR Martin] set out to do – which is flipping this kind of story on its head.&rdquo;
But how will the show come to an end? Who will die and who will survive? Who will sit on the Iron Throne finally? A lot of questions will be answered in the Game of Thrones season 8.
The ending will, for sure, make us all emotional, don’t you think? Well, Kit Harington AKA Jon Snow said that he cried twice during the read-through for the script.
&ldquo;The second time was the very end. Every season, you read at the end of the last script 'End of Season 1' or 'End of Season 2'. This read 'End of Game of Thrones'. And you realise, OK, it's really happening.&rdquo;
Well, he is not the only one, Sophie Turner who plays Sansa Stark on the show had also admitted that she burst into tears reading the last page of the script.

&ldquo;It was very, very bittersweet… The first day of the actors coming in and that kind of production starting, the day where we had the final read through for the final script... it was really bittersweet. It was hard. t the end of the very last script, they read aloud, 'End of Game of Thrones'. As soon as they read that out, pretty much everyone burst into tears,&rdquo; she had said.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
