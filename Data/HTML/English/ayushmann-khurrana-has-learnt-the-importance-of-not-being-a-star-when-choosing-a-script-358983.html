He is one of the few actors in the industry who aligns his fortunes with great content rather than big banners. The actor has most recently starred in small budget flicks Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho and proved that the audience knows good cinema.
With Andhadhun, Ayushmann is now 10 films old in Bollywood and we decided to mark the occasion, with a little exclusive chat on how 2018 treated him, what worked, and what didn’t.
Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho are case studies of Bollywood
He was pleasantly surprised when these smaller films matched up to the success of the typical masala film. Speaking about his recent success, Ayushmann says, &quot;For me, the unique content really worked, the appreciation from the audience towards this kind of cinema really worked. It's a two-way thing, a give and take between content and the audience. The tonality of my films Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho were not typically commercial, but they matched the numbers of commercial masala blockbusters films, it's like a case study.&quot;

We definitely agree.
Work in movies which have no reference point at all and yet commercial

Ayushmann has a formula for making his films work and after featuring in a series of hit films, he swears by it. &quot;It's a default setting for me to choose novel content. I am attracted to films with no reference point in cinema and yet are entertaining at the same time. It has to be the middle path getting both commercial and critical acclaim. It's intuition. I believe I am the audience and then if you look at it like that, it's easier to choose films.&quot;
Discard the trappings of stardom when choosing a film
As the year ends, Ayushmann reveals what 2018 taught him. &quot;It is important to follow your gut, just don't go by a lot of opinions and remove the garb of a star when you're choosing a script. Be the audience.&quot;
Always keep your spirits high, no matter what

While his year was on an upswing professionally, personally, he was dealing with a mountain of things all by himself. Speaking about it, Ayushmann said, &quot;Life is never perfect. When there was a professional high, I was supporting my wife in a battle with cancer. It’s important to be stable and as rational as possible. The idea is to keep your spirits high even if you're dealing with the worst of circumstances.
Marital status doesn't make you desirable, your talent does
As we all know, Ayushmann Khuranna is married to his childhood sweetheart, Tahira Kashyap and the couple has two kids. And despite his family and marital status, Ayushmann is still loved and adored by his fans. There are some on Twitter who even want to date him or marry him. Speaking about being one of India's most desirable men, Ayushmann said, &quot;You always get attracted to a guy or girl who have a great character. So, you being committed or married has nothing to do with people being attracted to you. I believe you get attracted to people who have great talent or character.&quot;
Be persistent, evolve everyday.

Ayushmann has had his share of difficulties in paving his way into the world of Bollywood. Being an outsider, Ayushmann started his journey with Roadies, followed by a stint in Radio and is now a full-fledged actor. And his advice for people who want to make a mark in this industry is to ‘be persistent, evolve every day and surround yourself with people who are practical and not yes men’. &quot;Be with people who give you perspective and are real, he says.
If content is different in a big budget commercial masala film or even Netflix, I will definitely take it up.

Speaking about digital media, Ayushmann feels the platform is lenient with censorship so the content is edgier and more progressive compared to the silver screen.

Although he finds fiction boring, Ayushmann is open to hosting and anchoring shows on TV. Ayushmann feels it was difficult during his time to make a debut, but now one can just sit in isolation and make an account digital platform and get famous. &quot;It 's a lot easier to have access, it was difficult earlier.&quot;
Well, we hope Ayushmann keeps surprising us with better projects and 2019 is even more fabulous for audiences seeking content-driven cinema.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
