A tip for Indian men : A black woolly turtleneck can make most of you seem exponentially smarter, especially if you don’t ask the woman sitting on the other side of your precious jar of granola what ‘exponentially’ means. Also it doesn’t help if you call the other person ‘Maha Pakau’ when they try to give you the correct definition. #TravelDiaries
