Believe It Or Not, Jameela Jamil's Body Positive Cover Is Unedited & Shot On A Smartphone
The global fashion industry has seen some revolutionary changes in the last two years. From plus-size models walking down the ramps at major fashion weeks to the much-needed acceptance of faces across ethnicity and diversity on magazine covers. This is the change we have been waiting for all along.
And Harper's Bazaar India's latest cover - The Body Issue with Jameela Jamil proves the conversation and movement around body positivism is not going anywhere, and it's time to change how we perceive beauty.
Jameela has always been an unapologetic advocate for body positivity, and even for this cover shoot she insisted her photographs are sans any sort of digital retouching or airbrushing. It has to be as authentic as it gets, just like her.

However, that was not the only thing that caught our attention.
For the very first time ever, Harper's Bazaar India shot an entire cover on the soon-to-be-released OnePlus 7 Pro, and as you can already see the results are nothing less than sensational.
The OnePlus 7 launch will take place in three cities simultaneously i.e New York, London and Bangalore on May 14 at 8:15 PM IST.
Going by the photos from the shoot, it is safe to say that OnePlus 7 Pro's camera will be a total gamechanger. In fact, we hear OnePlus 7 Pro is rumoured to include a pop-up camera selfie camera instead and also have QHD+ 90Hz AMOLED display. Honestly? We cannot wait for the launch to happen, and those of who you canâ€™t make it to the event, you can live stream it here.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
