Ranbir Kapoor To Share Screen Space With His 'Cine Idol' Sanjay Dutt In ‘Shamshera’
Becoming Sanjay Dutt was like a &ldquo;a fan trying to play his icon on-screen&rdquo; – that’s what Ranbir Kapoor had said on playing Sanjay Dutt in his biopic Sanju.
He said that the fanboy in him was scared to play the role onscreen but he couldn’t let go of the opportunity because the screenplay was &quot;sent from heaven&quot;.

Having grown up watching Sanjay Dutt’s films, Ranbir Kapoor is a great fan of Sanjay Dutt. He is so mesmerised by his aura that during his teens he had a poster of him on the walls of his room.
Ranbir Kapoor has often shared that Sanjay Dutt is his idol, and he wishes to share screen space with him one day. And looks like the day has arrived sooner than he expected.
Although, the duo came together for a song in Sanju, this one is extra special for Ranbir.
In his next action-adventure film Shamshera, Ranbir Kapoor is playing the role of a dacoit, and Sanjay Dutt is also playing a small role in it.
