Soni Razdan Has An Epic Response For Trolls Asking Her To Leave India And Go To Pakistan!
Alia Bhatt's mother and veteran actress Soni Razdan is currently busy promoting her upcoming film 'No Fathers In Kashmir'. During an interview with Nav Bharat Times, Soni, was quizzed on the current situation of the Kashmir Valley, to which she had an interesting take.
Without fearing that she could get labeled as anti-national, she expressed her views in an unfiltered manner. She had the funniest take on why she would want to relocate to Pakistan. Soni Razdan said:
Twitter
&quot;Ab jab main aisi baatein karti hoon toh log mujhe deshdrohi kehkar Pakistan behjna shuru kar dete hain. Kabhi kabhi main sochti hoon ki haan, mujhe Pakistan hi chale jana chahie, main bohat khush rahungi Pakistan jaakar, wahan khana bhi bohat achha hai. Yahan toh bhagate hain log mujhe, bohat baar mujhe logon ne kaha ki tum Pakistan jaao, lekin meri tarah ki soch rakhne wale bohat zyada log hain, isliye mujhe isse koi zyada fark nahi padta hai ki kaun kya kehta hai.&quot;
But trolls being trolls, they did what they're best at. They started trolling her for her statement.

@Soni_Razdan get out of India if you feel unsafe or unhappy here.
People like you should be kicked off, or sent to Afghanistan, iraq, Pakistan Or Syria.
Because you are privileged, and born in this country you don't recognize the value of it,I will kick your ass if you return pic.twitter.com/Zp4sv6K90U — yash mishra (@yashmis08778218) April 3, 2019
Alia Bhatt’s mother says she would be happier in #Pakistan, knowing she would be called a traitor in #India for such comments.
Soni Razdan is known for her outspoken personality & due to which she has been harassed for her statements. She has been called as ‘Deshdrohi’ by trolls. pic.twitter.com/EtpM2T6LMs — Zain Khan (@ZKhanOfficial) April 2, 2019
But instead of giving it back to the haters with negativity, she had a dignified response.
Aww flattered to get all this attention from these lovely people. Who seem to be so hot and bothered about me going to Pak for a meal. Just taking a cue from our PM actually who pops in there for tea smtimes ! Sry to disappoint but no intention of moving. I ❤️my India too much 😘 https://t.co/Q2V1cmURev — Soni Razdan (@Soni_Razdan) April 2, 2019
