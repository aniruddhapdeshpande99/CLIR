The court had on January 8 ordered police to lodge an FIR against the actors and 12 others on a complaint filed by advocate Sudhir Kumar Ojha with a plea that the movie presented Manmohan Singh and a number of other public figures in bad light.
Ojha said he had moved the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate Saba Alam on February 4 to mention that its order was not complied with by the police.
