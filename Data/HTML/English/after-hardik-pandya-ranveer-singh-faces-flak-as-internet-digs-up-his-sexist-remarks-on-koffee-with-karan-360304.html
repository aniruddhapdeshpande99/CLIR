After Hardik Pandya, Ranveer Singh Faces Flak As Internet Digs Up His Sexist Remarks On Koffee With Karan
The controversy stirred up by Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul is refusing to die down. Even after Hardik Pandyaâ€™s public apology, BCCI has imposed a temporary ban on the cricketer. While the sexist and misogynistic comments were passed by Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul laughed them off as 'jokes'. Of course, that gave rise to a massive outrage that no oneâ€™s forgetting anytime soon.
Now, the internet has dug up an old video of Ranveer Singh on the same show, Koffee With Karan, in which he is making some cringe-worthy remarks. And yet again, Karan Johar is laughing his heart out at them. Take a look!
&ldquo;You want your ass pinched? Iâ€™m right here,&rdquo; he says in one of the videos.

&ldquo;I went from child to boy while watching Kareena (Kapoor) swim,&rdquo; he says in another one.
