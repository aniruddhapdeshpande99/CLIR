Be it Babu bhaiya, Raju or Ghanshyam – each character left us howling with laughter. It was a class apart comedy movie.
From Baburao’s daily struggle with people dialling his number to talk to Devi Prasad to the ‘Utha Le Dhoti’ scene, Baburao’s comebacks to Sunil Shetty’s flirty skills, the love-hate chemistry of the trio is legendary. &ldquo;Agar subah subah sandaas jaana hai toh singer banna padega&rdquo; – remember this scene? This still tickles our funny bones. And this one was simply epic, &ldquo;Kutriya Saala, dekh ke number dial kar.&rdquo;
