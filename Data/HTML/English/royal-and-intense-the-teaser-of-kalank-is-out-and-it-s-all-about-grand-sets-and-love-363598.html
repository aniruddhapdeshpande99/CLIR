The teaser is heavily dominated with two major dialogues: &quot;Kuchh rishte karzon ke tarah hote hain. Jinhe nibhana nahi, chukana padhta hai,&quot; and &quot;Jab kisi aur ki barbaadi jeet jaise laage... toh humse zyada barbaad aur koi nahi hai iss duniya mein,&quot;- and they speak a lot about the plot.
