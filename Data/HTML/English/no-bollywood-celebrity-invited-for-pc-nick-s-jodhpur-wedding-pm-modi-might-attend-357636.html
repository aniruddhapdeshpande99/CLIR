Seeing their love stories find a happy ever after is definitely a feeling that makes our heart happy too.
The year began with Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja's wedding. And now, we are not even over DP-Ranveer's wedding celebrations and we have another royal wedding.

Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have chosen Jodhpur to tie the knot and the celebrations have already begun for the couple. The couple flew down to Jodhpur yesterday with their close friends and family in attendance.
But if you are wondering whether these celebrations will get a filmy twist with Bollywood celebrities making a cut in their guest list, you're mistaken. According to reports, no Bollywood celebrity has been invited for the wedding ceremonies and functions that will take place in Jodhpur.

However, after exchanging vows, the couple will fly back to Mumbai and Delhi for the grand receptions.

Another interesting detail that has been revealed about the Niyanka wedding is that the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has also been extended an invitation by the couple but considering that he has been traveling abroad for his commitments, he might have to give these celebrations a miss.

A few reports claim that Nick's dad, Paul Kevin Jonas, will officiate their Christian wedding. The couple will have two wedding ceremonies â€“ a traditional Indian-style ceremony and a Christian service soon after.
The couple got engaged in August in Mumbai and are all set to take the next step towards their happy forever amidst close ones in Jodhpur. Jonas and Chopra have booked Umaid Bhawan Palace for five days.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
