Soon enough, film and trade analyst, Trade Adarsh took to Twitter to announce the new name of the film, Why Cheat India. The movie released this Friday to lukewarm response and poor performance at the box office.
#WhyCheatIndia is a non-starter... Needs miraculous growth over the weekend to post a decent total... Fri ₹ 1.71 cr. India biz. — taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) January 19, 2019
While some touted the subject line boring, some thought Emraan didn't fit into the role very well. But looks like there is a prime reason why the movie didn't make the kind of money t should have.

Why Cheat India has become the latest victim to piracy. Tamilrockers, the torrent website, have uploaded the copy of the film and many people have got their hands on it. This is not the first time, Tamilrockers have done this.
Last week only, Uri also fell prey to piracy among many other Bollywood films. It's ironic how a film like 'How Cheat India' where Emraan Hashi plays the role of a Conman has got into a similar set up.
