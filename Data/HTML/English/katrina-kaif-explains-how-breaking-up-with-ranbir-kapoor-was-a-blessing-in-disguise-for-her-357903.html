&ldquo;I now see it (the breakup) as a blessing because I was able to recognize my patterns, thought processes and things that I had been so sure of my whole life. I could see them from a whole different perspective,&rdquo;
She added how this break-up added a different perspective on her own life and how she began to focus on herself. She adds,

She further added how she likes to be a reserved personality. She added,

&ldquo;It has been wonderful because I’m really enjoying the process of creating. It began with Aanand L Rai’s Zero, and then with Bharat—even though it came to me out of the blue, the process has been wonderful. I’ve enjoyed learning, and I feel incredibly happy at work when I feel like I’m learning something new.&quot;
Kaif is currently busy promoting her upcoming film Zero, that stars SRK and Anushka Sharma in pivotal roles.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
