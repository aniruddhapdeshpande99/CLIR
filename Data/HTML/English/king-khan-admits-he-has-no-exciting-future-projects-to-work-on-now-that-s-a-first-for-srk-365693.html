After a string of flops, SRK has no qualms in admitting that he still doesn't have something concrete and scintillating in hand.
Twitter
Speaking to a Chinese publication, the actor said, &ldquo;I haven’t decided what I will do next. I thought I will take a few months off and try and work on what I want to do because it’s very important for me to be most excited about it. I work 16 hours a day, so if it doesn’t excite you in the morning, you should not wake up. At my stage, when I have worked in over 80 films, have done some satisfactory roles and have made a career out of what I do, I should be like I don’t want to get up and go if it’s not going to be an absolutely, stunning, scintillating and exciting day as an actor. So, right now I don’t have anything that stunning, scintillating and exciting, If I will have it, I will start working on it.&rdquo;
