Bipasha Basu Congratulates Newly Weds Aakash Ambani And Shlokha Mehta With An Adorable Post
2019 witnessed one of the biggest weddings in India. Mega industrialists Mukesh Ambani's son Akash Ambani tied the knot with Shloka Mehta in a royal ceremony that happened in Mumbai.
The festivities started from Winter Wonderland where India's richest man organised pre-wedding functions for his son and daughter-in-law in the most beautiful way. From foreign delegates, Bollywood A-listers, politicians, the who's who in the country and abroad came to wish the couple of the moment.
Despite keeping everything overseas, the Ambani's preferred a Mumbai wedding and reception. SRK, Karan Johar, Aamir Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were seen at the baraat, representing Akash Ambani, and grooving to the Dhol and lighting up the atmosphere with their moves.

Taking to Instagram, Bipasha uploaded an emotional post for them.
She wrote, &quot;Congratulations to the newly weds @aambani1 and @shloka11. Wishing the wonderful couple happiness forever.&quot;
This is not the first time she has wished a celebrity couple. She has even wished Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone in the past when they tied the knot.
Isn't Bipasha Basu the sweetest of them all? We hope to have such friends too</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
