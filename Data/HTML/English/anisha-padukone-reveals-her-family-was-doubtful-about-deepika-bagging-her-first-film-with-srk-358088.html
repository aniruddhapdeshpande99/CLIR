Initially, when she planned to make her career in Bollywood and informed her family about getting a film with Shah Rukh Khan, it was unbelievable for them. Deepika's sister Anisha Padukone in an interview with a magazine revealed how the family was skeptical about her getting a film with SRK,
Twitter
&ldquo;When she (Deepika) informed us that Farah Khan had promised her a movie with SRK, we were a bit skeptical and asked her not to stop looking for more options. But when we realized she has actually signed the contract, all of us were very happy,&rdquo;
Twitter
Anisha even revealed that DP always wanted to be a performer, &ldquo;Deepika and I were in the same school until I was in 4th grade. She always loved to participate in school plays, dancing and performing for the Teacher's Day, the usual things kids do in school.&rdquo;
Twitter
Anisha shares one anecdote too. She said, &ldquo;One incident our mother tell us about is that during one of her performances in school she imitated the principal and that too in a convent school, where things like these are not easily accepted. Surprisingly, everyone loved her act because it was so good&rdquo;.

With all the love and support from her family, Deepika Padukone became what she is - a superstar.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
