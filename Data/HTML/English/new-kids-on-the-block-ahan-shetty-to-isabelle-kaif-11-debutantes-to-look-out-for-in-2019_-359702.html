It's very important for newcomers, especially with non starry background, to choose their debut film as it decides the fate of their career. While he was offered many films in the past, Mohit Raina chose Uri as his debut film. A strong subject with a meaty role is what clicked with the actor. Also, a patriotic film was something he felt was close to his heart. Th movie is slated to release on 11th January, 2019.

She made news for all the wrong reasons. There were reports she was sexually harassed by her co-star Sushant Singh Rajput during the sets of Kizy Aur Manny. In fact, the director of the film, Mukesh Chabbra was also allegedly reported for misbehavior towards aspiring actresses.
While Sanjana denied the rumours of Sushant Singh's harassment news, Mukesh had to step down from his directorship. Despite the film seeing these ups and downs, Kizy Aur Manny will release this year.
