People say that he can’t really handle his drinks. When he is drunk, he becomes a totally different person. His Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde, personality is known to his colleagues. I heard many such incidents after I had finished working with him in 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun' and tele-serial Imtihaan, in which he played my father.

In Imtihaan, our father-daughter bond was so strong and it was so wonderful working with him, but then, I started hearing stories that he harasses women when he is drunk. It was so shocking for me because I couldn’t put these two faces together.
She admitted that she knew about the incident that occurred with her Deepika Amin, &ldquo;Obviously, she is my friend. I can’t just go out and say this is what she has faced. Alok Nath was a big name... On Television, he was the top star. People believed in him because of the work he did, he was a fantastic actor and still is.&rdquo;

And now Renuka Shahne has come out with a solution. Taking to Facebook, she assured the young struggles to not be afraid to enter this field and be cautious of a few things that will not land you in trouble.
In an interview with a leading entertainment portal, the actress even narrated her own #MeToo story.
I had gone to shoot to Noida for ‘Antakshari’. There was this person who came for room service and he started masturbating in front of me.
First, he said that he is a big fan of mine and all that and I said thank you. After placing the food, he started masturbating. It is such a horrifying thing and I immediately told him to get out and will complaint with the manager.
I called my ‘Antakshari’ assistant Ashwini to come up to the room and stay with me. I was so shaken to the core. Since then, I am never alone in my room. I am always with my hairdresser. People feel that only in the industry such incidence happen but there are so many random people whom you have to deal with.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
