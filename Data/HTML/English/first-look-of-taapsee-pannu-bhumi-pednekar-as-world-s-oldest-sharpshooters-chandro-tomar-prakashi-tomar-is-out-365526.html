&quot;It has been an intense experience. I feel it is one of the most difficult roles of my career. I don't know how I am going to do it so, I am taking each day as it comes and trying to give my best.&quot;

&quot;Both Bhumi and Taapsee have put their heart and soul into the characters right from the initial prep to the training and their looks. The film is the perfect platform for them to reach their true potential as powerhouse performers.&quot;
