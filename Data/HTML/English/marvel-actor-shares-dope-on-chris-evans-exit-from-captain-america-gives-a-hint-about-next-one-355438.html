Fans are divided between Bucky Barnes played by Sebastian Stan and Sam Wilson by Anthony Mackie.
RUMOR: @AnthonyMackie's Sam Wilson may be the one to take over the mantle of Captain America post-AVENGERS 4. https://t.co/In50UYWnnl pic.twitter.com/pndBgRtNT7 — MCU News & Tweets (@MCU_Tweets) October 24, 2018
What if they make Sam Wilson Cap, and give him a movie with Bucky/White Wolf, so we finally get that Captain America's Best Friends buddy movie we all really want? pic.twitter.com/jr43un8RT4 — Jeremy Conrad (@ManaByte) October 24, 2018

Sam Wilson is fine, but it should be Bucky first due to chronological order. Also, Peggy is dead in the MCU so she can't be Cap. Also don't need a female Captain America when we're going to have Captain Marvel running around — Joshua Carpenter (@gambit458) October 24, 2018
We're yet to see who grabs the throne. Meanwhile, Avengers 4 will hit the screens on May 3,2019.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
