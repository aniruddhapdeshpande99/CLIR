In his blog, the actor mentioned how sewage workers go down the manholes of the city, to clean, in the most inhuman conditions without any proper equipment of safety care.
After several deaths were reported of these workers, Big B explained what it takes to become a sewage worker.
Manual scavenging refers to the practice of manually cleaning, carrying, disposing or handling in any manner, human excreta from dry latrines and sewers,&quot; Amitabh wrote in his blog.

&quot;They (workers) go down the manholes of the city, to clean, in the most inhuman conditions without any proper equipment of safety care. Many perish inside the pits due to asphyxiation and deadly fumes discriminated against...&quot;
&quot;I came across this information during the cleanathon of 15 hours recently and I am buying 50 machines for these workers so they do not have to enter the pits but are able to clean the manholes and sewers from outside with these machines, saving the indignity they suffer from the public.&quot;
The 'Thugs Of Hindostan' actor will be donating 50 machines to ensure workers don't face such problems ever again. He elaborated on the kind of machines he is planning to purchase.
&quot;The machines are fairly large, a bit cumbersome to operate, but do the job...,&quot; he said, adding that the ones he would get were of smaller size and could be personally owned by the worker.
&quot;There is the larger version too, that cannot be moved about other than on a truck .. this shall be presented by me to the Municipal Corporation .. in a day or two,&quot; he added.
We need more celebs like him.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
