Confirming the news, he told the publication, &ldquo;I read the book and was taken in by lawyer PC Solanki who fought the case for the victims against Asaram Bapu for free. The two lady police officers — one from Jodhpur and the other from Surat — are inspiring, too. In my eyes, they are the real heroes. We will focus on these people and the rest will be based on facts.

The cast will be decided once the script is ready.&rdquo;
