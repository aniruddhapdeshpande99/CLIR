Ever since the film has released, it has courted many controversies but Kangana has been on a mission to 'expose' each and every Bollywood celebrity who has ever wronged her.
In one of her promotional interviews for Manikarnika, she targeted Alia Bhatt and accused her of being a puppet, controlled by Karan Johar. She had said,
&ldquo;I reached out to Alia and asked her what makes her think Manikarnika is my personal controversy, it’s a film whole nation is talking about and wondering why Bollywood is keeping quiet on such a relevant work...I suggested that she grows some spine and supports an important film about woman empowerment and nationalism...if she doesn’t have a voice of her own and her existence is all about being KJo's (Karan Johar) puppet then I don’t consider her successful...I told her if she is only focusing on earning bucks and not raise a voice, then her success has no value...,&rdquo;
Reacting to Kangana's strong comments against her, she said,
&quot;I would like to react to her personally if she has any complaints. I don’t want to talk about it in the media. As I have said before, I really admire her as an actor and the choices that she makes. She’s a very outspoken person and I admire her for that as well. If I have upset her unintentionally, then I don’t know. Basically, it wasn’t my intention. I didn’t do anything to get a reaction like this.&quot;

Even earlier, Alia had a graceful reaction to Kangana's snide remarks. She had said,
&ldquo;I hope she doesn’t dislike me and I don’t think she dislikes me. I don’t think I have done anything intentionally to upset her. If I have, I will apologise to her on a personal level.&quot;
On the work front, Alia Bhatt is currently in Germany with her team of Gully Boy, attending the Berlin Film Festival and the premiere of her film.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
