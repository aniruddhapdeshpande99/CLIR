And fans are heartbroken.
You were the most comic book accurate Batman that has ever been brought to the screen. I'm so thankful that you told a redemptive story about Bruce Wayne in such a human way. Your portrayal reminds me that every fallen person (meaning, all of us) can be saved. pic.twitter.com/AlTFxRo5SA â€” Rebecca Johnson (@derbykid) January 31, 2019

If this is your way of saying goodbye then I just want to say thank you for giving us such a beautiful performance in BVS. I had the privilege of meeting you and what I told you remains the same. You will always be my Batman. Your performance saved my life. Iâ€™m gonna miss u ðŸ’” â€” mandy ðŸ¦‡ðŸ–¤ (@xbatflecksx) January 31, 2019

Thank you @BenAffleck for all the blood sweat and tears you've given us Batman fans over last the few years. pic.twitter.com/ARgTUQPiAP â€” Willam Kelly (@WillamKelley) January 31, 2019
Thank you for being my Batman and my Bruce Wayne, Ben.
You embodied everything I wanted to see from Batman on the big screen.
It's sad to see you hang the cape, really sad, but I guess all good things must come to an end.
Thank you. pic.twitter.com/ObWgts51Eu â€” â€¢BatMaxðŸ¦‡â€¢ #ReleaseTheSnyderCut (@SupesBatsy) January 31, 2019
