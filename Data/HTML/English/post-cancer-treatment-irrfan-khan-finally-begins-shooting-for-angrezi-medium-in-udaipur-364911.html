While Kareena Kapoor might play Irrfan's wife and a cop in the film, Pataakha and Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota actor Radhika Madan will be playing the role of his grown-up daughter in the film. The film will be majorly shot in Udaipur and London.
Just a few days ago, Irrfan Khan took to his social media accounts to thank all his fans for constantly keeping him in their prayers. In his note, he had written,
&ldquo;Maybe somewhere in the pursuit of winning, we forget how much it means to be loved. In our vulnerability, we are reminded. As I leave my footprints onto these steps of my life, I want to pause to be grateful for receiving your immense love and support, it soothed me in my process of healing. So I travel back to you, thanking you from the bottom of my heart.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
