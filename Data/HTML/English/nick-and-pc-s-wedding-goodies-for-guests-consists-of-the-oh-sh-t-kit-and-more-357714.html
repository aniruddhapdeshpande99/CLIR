Nick And PC's Wedding Goodies For Guests Consists Of 'The Oh Sh*t Kit' And More!
If Alladin's genie was real, many of us would wish to be invisible right now so that we can just fly down to Jodhpur to attend the royal Nick-Priyanka wedding.
I mean come on, everything about the wedding screams royal and exquisite.
From the helipad that has been made especially to ferry guests in and out to the wedding guests that the planners have customized for the guests, the preps for the wedding are on point.
As if we were not feeling terrible enough already that now palace-turned-luxury hotel took to their social media accounts to give us a glimpse of what all is there inside the goodie kit.
