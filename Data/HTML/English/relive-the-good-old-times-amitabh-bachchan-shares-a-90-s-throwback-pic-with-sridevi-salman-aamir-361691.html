The picture was apparently clicked during the rehearsals for Jhumma Chumma concert in London‚Äôs Wembley Stadium. &ldquo;Those were the days .. never before a concert at Wembley Stadium from India .. and on my insistence took Salman and Aamir for their first one ..&rdquo; wrote Amitabh Bachchan in the caption.

Salman is all smiles with a glint in his eyes. Perhaps, that was his fanboy moment with Amitabh Bachchan.
Fans were left nostalgic.
