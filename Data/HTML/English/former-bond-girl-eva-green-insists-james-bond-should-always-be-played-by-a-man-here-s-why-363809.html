Daniel Craig is set to leave the franchise after the release of Cary Fukunaga's Bond 25 in April 2020 and there is already a lot of speculation about his replacement with names such as Idris Elba and Richard Madden doing the rounds.
But Eva Green thinks roping in a woman would be a bad idea.
&ldquo;I'm for women, but I really think James Bond should remain a man. It doesn't make sense for him to be a woman. Women can play different types of characters, be in action movies, and be superheroes, but James Bond should always be a man and not be Jane Bond. There is history with the character that should continue. He should be played by a man,&rdquo; Green told Vanity Fair on the Dumbo red carpet.

Furthermore, talking about her character, Eva Green said that she is proud of the fact that Vesper Lynd brought a change in the way Bond girls were perceived.
&ldquo;I originally had reservations about being a Bond girl. I didn’t want to be a bimbo. The women are now perceived differently. They are intelligent and sassy and fascinating. I loved playing Vesper. She’s the only one to get to Bond’s heart and has a big impact on his life,&rdquo; she said.
Bond 25 will be Craig's fifth outing as 007 following Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre.
