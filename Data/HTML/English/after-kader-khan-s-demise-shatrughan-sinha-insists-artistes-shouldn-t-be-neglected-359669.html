&ldquo;Why was he in Canada during the time of his death? Kader Khan has given so much to our entertainment industry...What a sad start to 2019. There is a lesson to be learnt from Kader Khan's death in a foreign country. We need to take better care of our artistes so that they don't feel neglected,&rdquo; he told IANS.
Shatrughan Sinha has worked with Kader Khan in several films.
&ldquo;Kader Khan was one of the pillars of Bollywood. He was not just an excellent actor who fitted into any role, but also an outstanding writer. Both Amitabh and I were very closely associated with him. I knew him from the time he wrote Manmohan Desai's 'Naseeb' and Prakash Mehra's 'Jwalamukhi', both of which I starred in,&rdquo; he added.
