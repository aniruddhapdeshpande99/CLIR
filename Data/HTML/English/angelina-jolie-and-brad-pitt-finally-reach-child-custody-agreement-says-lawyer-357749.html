Jolie and Pitt, once one of Hollywood’s most glamorous couples, separated in September 2016 after a more than 10-year romance and two-year marriage. Jolie, who filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences, had been seeking primary custody of their six children, three of whom are the couple’s biological children and three of whom are adopted.
Friday’s statement did not say how custody would be divided, and Jolie’s spokesperson declined to give details. A trial date in the custody case had been tentatively set for December 4 before a private judge in Los Angeles. A source close to Jolie said that she &ldquo;is very pleased to be entering the next stage and relieved with progress for the health of their family.&rdquo;

The 2016 divorce filing triggered a bitter custody dispute during which Pitt was investigated and cleared of child abuse, and both sides accused each other of trying to manipulate media coverage in their favour. The couple are yet to reach a final divorce settlement.
