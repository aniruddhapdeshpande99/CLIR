&ldquo;I've not met Sreesanth after the break-up, but I have been watching him on Bigg Boss. Sreesanth claimed on national television that he was in love with Bhuvneshwari for seven years before he got married to her. This makes me wonder, why was he in a live-in relationship with me for over a year around that time,&rdquo; Nikesha told Bangalore Times.
The actress also claimed that Sreesanth broke off with her without giving her a closure and that she has many unanswered questions. She also said that he is not as &ldquo;mahaan&rdquo; as he pretends to be on the show.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
