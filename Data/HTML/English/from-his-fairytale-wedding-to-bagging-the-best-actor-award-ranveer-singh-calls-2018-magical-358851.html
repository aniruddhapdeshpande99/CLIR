Wanted To Do Masala Film Only With Rohit Shetty Because He Is The Best
&quot;It is my biggest film so far, it has me as in and as, it is a film that has mounted me as a solo hero. This time it’s me as Rohit Shetty’s leading man and that’s a big deal for me. This film was offered to me as Bajirao Mastani, I always wanted to do masala films, but I didn’t want to do masala films if it wasn’t with Rohit Shetty. To me there is nobody who gets it right other than him. I really only wanted to do this genre with him because he is the king to me in this genre.&quot;

Was Ready To Play Lakhan But Nobody Offered Me
The actor expressed how he desired to play Lakhan for Rohit and KJo's Ram Lakhan, &quot; I was never offered Ram Lakhan. I was ready to do Lakhan but I don’t know what happened about that, that was a film that Karan and Rohit sir was supposed to make it together, but today we are here and Simmba is backed by these two massive filmmakers.&quot;
Masala Film Does Not Get The Credit That It Deserves
Ranveer stated that playing Ballerao was the most difficult task for him in Simmba, &quot;I am not the one who decides if this character is award-worthy or not but all I can say is that I have given my best and this is my best character that I have done because there is one character who has portrayed all the emotions together in the film right form romance, action, comedy and drama. The drama is intense, from a performer's point of view, it was painstaking to make a masala film, because not enough credit is given to this genre.&quot;

It Was His Dream To Kiss Deepika And Go On Stage To Receive The Best Actor Award
The man surely wins the best husband title after sharing this dream with Deepika,&quot; Yesterday was a magical moment, I didn’t get emotional Deepika got emotional for various reasons. I don’t prepare my speeches before getting awards. I am very superstitious in that way. I don’t want to jinx it. So I just show up at the award ceremony, and then go at the stage and get lost about what to say, and once you are there with the mic and everyone is waiting for you to speak, you have no filter you just speak your mind. I was just speaking my heart, I always had this dream, Deepika will be sitting next to me and I will be announced as the best actor, I will kiss Deepika and then go up on stage and receive my award, and that happened and it was magical. She is a large part of my growth, she is the large part of my evolution, she kept me grounded and centered. She was my support, especially when I was doing Khilji, she helped me a lot, it was something very difficult for both of us. It was a difficult year for both of us, the year we shot Padmavaat, we were being tested, I guess for her to witness that and then witness this it was magical for her too.&quot;
I Would Be Burn To Crisp If Any Other Would Do Gully Boy Other Than Me
Twitter
Ranveer talks about how he would be supremely jealous if anyone else would play his character in Gully Boy, &quot;After Padmaavat, I did Gully Boy and completed it and then did Simmba. In Gully Boy I had to be this quiet boy who deals with a lot of inner emotions. In fact after shooting for a scene, I used to not even see the monitor, we shot the entire film and I didn’t even see one scene of mine, I had no clue about it, after the shooting Zoya went to New York for 6 months for the edit of the film, and just yesterday she showed me the teaser of the film and I was like F***K. It is that crazy, I swear if there would be an actor other than me in this teaser I would be burnt to crisp, I would be damn jealous of that actor. It’s Mumbai, its Hip hop, It’s ME&quot;.
2018 Has Been Amazing
Undoubtedly this year is an amazing year for Ranveer and he agrees, &quot; This is year has been amazing to me, I started with Padmavaat, than I did this creatively, enriching and fulfilling film like Gully Boy - a story of this Mumbai boy with hip-hop. It’s so special, then I also had a sad phase, I lost my Nani. But my family bonded at that time, if there was any silver lining at such a time it was just this that my family bonded well. After that was Simmba where I had a ball, being a masala hero, then comes the highlight of the year which is my marriage, my wife curated such a beautiful wedding. I keep on telling her, I didn’t have the vision of this which she created in our wedding, even I would have never dreamt of it, so full credit to her. It was a fairytale, every time was just BEAUTIFUL, then I see December and I see all this heat surrounding Simmba. The trailer goes to the roof, Aankh Maare has become this rage party anthem, Tere Bin is doing extremely well, then I won the best actor award. It’s like I couldn’t have asked for more, it can’t get better than this.&quot;
Excited To Welcome 2019
He is optimistically looking forward to 2019, &quot;Creatively I am very excited for 2019. In January I am going to start for 1983 film, where I am going to play Kapil Dev and then I will be doing Takht with Karan Johar. I am really looking forward to 2019.&quot;

I Am Not An Insecure Actor To Not Do A Two-Hero Film
The actor was asked if would be okay to do a two-hero film as KJo once said it's difficult to get two big actors together for a film, he said, &quot; I am not one who shies away from two heroes or ensemble cast film and I have shown that in my film choices. I have no insecurities on taking on these films I have no greed to have everything, I am happy to collaborate with other artists that creates cinematic magic. I think I don’t want to judge anyone but if you ask my opinion, it would be rather foolish to pass on the opportunity of a great script which has two heroes or ensemble cast if you are a secure actor, there is no reason one shouldn’t do it. Also today things are changing, the power has gone to audience's hands, they will not watch anything that you will throw to them. They now want the best content, and this time the actors will opt for stories and not look at the star cast of the film. The time will soon come where two heroes will be working together because the story of the film is great like it used to happen.&quot;

Open To Do Web Series But Right Now My Focus Is Only Big Screen
Ranveer doesn't mind doing web series but not now, &quot; I am open to it, I am close to it, I never say never, I am very open minded like that. Good Content is good content, I loved Sacred Games, I am so proud of what Vikramaditya has achieved in his own precedent. After Sacred Games people have really taken this platform very seriously. I think it’s great and I would love to be a part of it. But my focus right now is big screen experiences because in my opinion what has happened in past few years, screens have been getting smaller and smaller, nowadays foot halls are suffering and it’s fair enough because halls have become freaking expensive. Nowadays, if you take a family package for gold class it’s 7000 bucks, and then you have to accommodate all of them in a car and if you live in a metro city like Mumbai or Delhi you have to face this traffic and after all that you have to fight for a parking, then stand in a line for popcorn. Fighting all this, I am brain fried by now and if you are not going to give me good content then why would I come there, so better we make worth it for them. So when you make something you should make sure that it is worth for big screen.&quot;
