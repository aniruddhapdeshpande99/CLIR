The trailer shows the story of a young boy named Kanhaiya who lives in a slum where there are no toilets. Just like every other kid, he is bound by his love for mother Sargam. One fine day, when Sargam is on her way back from relieving herself, she is raped. The little boy is, of course, heartbroken. He writes a letter to the prime minister and decides to travel to the national capital with his friends in order to make his voice heard.
Watch the deep and intense trailer of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Mere Pyaare Prime Minister below.
The movie is slated to release on March 15. Ask Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra if he will show the movie to the prime minister, and he says, he won’t follow the trend by organising a special screening for him.

&ldquo;No, not at all. We don't have any such plans, yet. It has become very fashionable, I would rather want to stay away from it.&rdquo;
However, he says, if he wishes to watch it on his own will, it will be a matter of great honour for him.
&ldquo;I feel the film is made for the people of the country and somewhere I don’t want to dilute that by using such a big office. He is a very busy man and is running the country...To take three hours of his time which he could devote to some national and international interest. Just because I want to promote, it doesn't suit me. But, If he wants to watch the film, it'll be an honour,&rdquo; he told PTI.
Mere Pyaare Prime Minister stars Anjali Patil, Om Kanujiya and Atul Kulkarni among others.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
