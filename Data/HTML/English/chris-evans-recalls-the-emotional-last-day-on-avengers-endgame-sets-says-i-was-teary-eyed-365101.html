Eight years after first playing Captain America, Chris Evans had an emotional last day. &ldquo;I was pretty teary-eyed. It has nothing to do with the plot. It's just the fact that it's the culmination of a really long endeavour. It wraps up the journey for a lot of the characters,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying in an interview with AP.
When asked as to who was most emotional on the sets, Mark Ruffalo said, &ldquo;That was probably Scarlett. She usually gets really emotional.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bring a box of Kleenex and a diaper,&rdquo; Ruffalo said on Good Morning America.

&ldquo;It is the end of a 22, 21 movie tapestry, a 10-year process. This has been an enormous part of my life, it’ll follow me till the day I die. And when you think about it, it’s easy to get emotional about it. You try to prepare yourself for the completion and the day came and it was more than I thought it was gonna be. I was really, really beside myself. It just, it got me. I’m an emotional guy.&rdquo;
