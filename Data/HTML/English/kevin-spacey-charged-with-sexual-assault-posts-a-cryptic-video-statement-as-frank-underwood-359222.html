&quot;I know what you want,&quot; he begins. &quot;Oh sure, they may have tried to separate us, but what we have is too strong, it's too powerful. After all, we shared everything, you and I. I told you my deepest, darkest secrets. I showed you exactly what people are capable of. I shocked you with my honesty, but mostly I challenged you and made you think.&quot;
&quot;You trusted me even though you knew you shouldn't. So we're not done, no matter what anyone says, and I know what you want. You want me back,&quot; he says in the clip.

&quot;Of course, some believed everything and have been waiting with bated breath to hear me confess it all, they're just dying to have me declare that everything said is true and that I got what I deserved. Wouldn't that be easy, if it was all so simple?&quot;
Spacey then closes out the video by stating, &quot;I feel surprisingly good and my confidence grows each day that soon enough you will know the full truth. Wait a minute, now that I think of it, you never actually saw me die, did you? Conclusions can be so deceiving. Miss me?&quot;
Spacey's character in Netflix's 'House of Cards' was killed off for the sixth and final season after he was fired from the political drama. Spacey faced a public fall from stardom in the wake of sexual harassment allegation levelled by actor Anthony Rapp. Following Rapp, many others came to the fore and described their tryst with sexual harassment they faced because of Spacey.
