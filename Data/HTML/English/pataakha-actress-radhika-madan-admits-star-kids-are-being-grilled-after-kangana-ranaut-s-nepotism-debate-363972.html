Indiatimes met Radhika for a quick interaction about her next film and lots more. While talking to us, Radhika had her chirpy mode on and happily answered all the questions. Looking adorable in a regular white tee paired with a sexy denim skirt, Radhika spoke her heart out with us.

&ldquo;Today is the best time for us because there are people ready to experiment and there is work for everyone. Plus the audience have become smart, you cannot fool them, they will take your case, like Kangana started this nepotism debate. Ever since then, whichever star kid is coming is being grilled. Infact, I feel they will stop getting opportunities also, it doesn’t matter whosoever son or daughter you are, you will only survive with talent and that’s the best part.

Also today, every filmmaker is experimenting, like Vishal sir didn’t have the need to give me a chance he could have taken anybody and they would happily do it for him, but even he is trying something new, so it’s just the best phase for everyone, not only actresses. Today, the directors don’t want to make films on super hit formulas even they want to try new stuff&rdquo;.

When we quizzed Radhika how calm she kept herself while choosing her second film as she saw an overnight success with her debut film, to which she said she has seen success in her TV career before and it was crazy, &quot;You get overnight success in TV and not movies, in television if your show is on air, you are god, and I have seen that stardom which I never imagined in my TV times, I was like aise kaise ho sakta hai. Itni log dekhte hai kya TV serial. But that time someone had told me which stuck in my head, that person said, Radhika, you will be god till your show is on air, once it goes off air people will forget you in a month. I realised that success is temporary and I do not want to get trapped in my ego, so I don’t get trapped&rdquo;.
Twitter
She further added, &quot;I just want to be honest in whatever I do, I just don’t want to reach that phase where my ego comes or I become dishonest or plastic and that will start reflecting in my acting, I just want to be honest and that’s my only fear.&rdquo;
The actress is strong headed and has made a right choice to not become egoistic with her success. More power to her.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
