Condom Brands Wish Newly Weds Ranveer-Deepika With Quirky Posts, Amul Pays Them A Tribute Too
It has been a magical week. Bollywood witnessed a fairytale wedding of the two mega stars. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone tied the knot in a private ceremony in Italy yesterday.
The couple who has been dating for the past 6 years planned a stunning all white wedding in the picturesque locales of Lake Como. While we managed to grab our hands on some grainy shots of their wedding, we're still awaiting clearer pictures of the couple.
As per reports, the couple is expected to release their wedding snaps at 6 PM today. Meanwhile Bollywood celebrities have been pouring wishes for their favourite couple on social media.
