With Grand Sets & Intense Emotions In 'Kalank', Is Karan Johar Trying To Follow In Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Footsteps?
He is a genius and a master of his art. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's films are an extravagant visual feast. Adjectives would fall short to describe such larger than life movies. From Devdas to Bajirao Mastani, his movies are nothing short of poetic experiences. He has an impeccable eye for details. From palatial sets to elaborate costumes, he is a master of storytelling.
On the other hand, Karan Johar is known for masala entertainers. While his films always have a happy ending, SLBâ€™s movies end on a sad note. KJo is known for his multi-starrer movies. He once even said that he fears what if his films stop working, and so he chooses to rope in many stars. Perhaps, he thinks the star-power works.

When the teaser of his upcoming movie â€“ again a multi-starrer â€“ was released, it had everything but the Karan Johar feels. Is Karan Johar trying to break into the grandeur and charm of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, everyone is asking.

Karan Johar pulls a Sanjay Leela Bhansali with his upcoming movie KALANk.

#Kalank teaser is filled with all the unused footage from Sanjay Leela Bhansali films. There, I said it. â€” simran (@simrankanal) March 12, 2019
People comparing #KalankTeaser with Padmaavat / Bajirao Mastani/ Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Vision are itself biggest Kalank in this world. â€” Sidharthâ™¡Malhotra (@Sidforever) March 13, 2019
Kalank tried too hard to create Sanjay leela Bhansaliâ€™s aura â€” childish bambino (@Ronakrebel) March 12, 2019
#Kalank references/copies Sanjay Leela Bhansaliâ€™s patent aesthetic. Itâ€™s a fact, this is not an argument. Fans need to understand that. The similarities are way too much.. â€” Sharad (@OmgSharad) March 13, 2019
Whatâ€™s more interesting is that Kalank is directed by Abhishek Varman, a man who is a great fan of Sanjay Leela Bhansali films. In fact, he has assisted Sanjay Leela Bhansali on several films as well, according to a DNA report.
Some people feel even the poster is copied!

What's more? To some people, the background score reminded them of Game of Thrones.
#Kalank BGM sounded like one of the Scores from GOT .
No wonder everyone is liking it :P â€” A r n a V (@Being_arnav_) March 12, 2019
Some even feel that the background score has been borrowed from popular TV series Flash!
Ye #KalankTeaser me The Flash ka BGM daal diya hai Indian version bana kar â€” Rishabh Srivastava (@AskRishabh) March 12, 2019
We know it's too early to decide. It's just a teaser. According to Karan Johar, Kalank is a &ldquo;story of turbulent relationships and eternal love&rdquo;.
