Talking About His Own Harassment Experience, Saif Ali Khan Says #MeToo Offenders Must Be Punished
It’s high time that the people understand the importance of consent. Just because you’re rich and powerful, it doesn’t give you the authority to misbehave, harass, molest or assault another person.
India’s #MeToo movement is finally here and women across the world are braving their families, peers, friends and acquaintances to come out with their stories of sexual harassment, because time is up now.

&ldquo;Most people don't understand other people. It is very difficult to understand other people's pain. I don't want to talk about it because I am not important today. Even when I think about what happened with me I still get angry. Today, we have to look after women,&rdquo; he added.
Furthermore, Saif Ali Khan says that the offenders must be punished even if they are found guilty in old cases.
&ldquo;People are offended and they want justice. What it is happening is good and it gives you a sense that something is happening. You are removing someone (from the job) and it is a big deal. You are removing a person, but everybody has worked on a project so you have to balance things. People who have sexually harassed and abused women should pay for it.&rdquo;

Talking about allegations against Sajid Khan and working with him on Humshakals, here’s what Saif Ali Khan said.
&ldquo;I don't remember anything like this happening genuinely because if it would have happened I would not have been comfortable in that environment or allowed it to happen in front of me… I would hate an atmosphere where women are being looked down upon or mistreated in any way. I don't think that's how an atmosphere should be.&rdquo;
