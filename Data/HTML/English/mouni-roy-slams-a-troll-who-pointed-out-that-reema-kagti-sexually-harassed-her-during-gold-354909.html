Mouni Roy Slams A Troll Who Pointed Out That Reema Kagti Sexually Harassed Her During 'Gold'
Just two days ago, 11 Indian women filmmakers took a stand as they decided to pledge to not work with proven offenders. On this list were makers Alankrita Shrivastava, Gauri Shinde, Kiran Rao, Konkona Sen Sharma, Meghna Gulzar, Nandita Das, Nitya Mehra, Reema Kagti, Ruchi Narain, Shonali Bose, and Zoya Akhtar.
This decision was shared on social media and that's when a Twitter user replied to Konkona's tweet accusing them of &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; and questioning Reema Kagti's involvement in the movement claiming that she's &ldquo;known to sexually harass Mouni Roy during Gold movie&rdquo;.
Twitter
As soon as Mouni Roy read this tweet, she decided to stand for herself and Reema Kagti. As a reply to the tweet, Mouni mentioned how she wasn't harassed on the set of Gold by any one – director or otherwise.

In her tweet, she even explained how callously putting out such maligning statements would draw away the attention from women, who have been wronged in real and whose MeToo stories and ordeal deserve the most attention. Slamming the user, Mouni made a very valid point with just one tweet.
I was not harassed on the set of Gold by anyone. Director or otherwise. I wish this maligning would stop as it not only harassing me and Reema Kagti but also taking away from women that have truly been wronged.@konkonas @rachitmehrotra https://t.co/QfApil8per — Mouni Roy (@Roymouni) October 14, 2018</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
