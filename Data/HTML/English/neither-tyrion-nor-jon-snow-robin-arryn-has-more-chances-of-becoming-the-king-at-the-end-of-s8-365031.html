Who are you putting your money on? Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are two popular choices of fans. But when it’s Game Of Thrones, expect the unexpected. And as the makers said, not everyone is going to be happy with the ending of Game Of Thrones season 8, we are sure, it’s going to be surprising enough.
Who else can sit on the Throne then? Cersei Lannister? It’s likely she would not live until the end. According to popular theories, Jamie might kill her before taking his own life.

Amid all the popular names, people completely forgot about Robin Arryn, right? According to Screen Rant’s Rose Moore, Robin Arryn, the sickly, immature son of Jon and Lysa Arryn, who died after being poisoned and pushed from the moon door respectively, has clear chances of winning the game.
When we first met Robin Arryn, he was creepily breastfeeding on his mother’s lap, and since then he has turned out to be quite a brat. But we totally forgot that he is currently the Lord of the Vale. Well, if that happens, it’s going to be a big shock.
