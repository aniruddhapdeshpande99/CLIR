While Ranveer had confirmed that there is no project in their kitty where they will be seen together, looks like the prayers of fans have finally been answered but they might have to wait a little longer.
The release date of the biopic is still not finalised but it will release somewhere in 2020.
According to a Deccan Chronicle report, Deepika Padukone has been offered to play the role of Ranveer Singh's onscreen wife in Kapil Dev's biopic 83. Helmed by Kabir Khan, the film will majorly revolve around the 1983 World Cup. A source is quoted in the report as saying,

&quot;Her role requires just seven days of shooting. The filmmakers believe the part where Romi Bhatia left the stadium mid-way assuming that West Indies will win the 1983 World Cup final, and the difficulties she encountered in coming back into the stadium when India was on the verge of winning, can be well emoted by Deepika.&quot;
Whether Deepika has given her nod or not is still a mystery but fans will definitely be delighted if this gets confirmed.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
