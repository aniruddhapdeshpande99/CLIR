#1 It could be about Essos!

Wondering what’s Essos? You sure know about Westeros – the continent located in the far west of the known world of Game of Thrones. It’s not the only continent in the world of Game of Thrones. There’s Essos as well – located in the East of the known world. Essos is the home of the Free Cities and it served as the backdrop to many of the Game Of Thrones's Daenerys Targaryen-centric storylines. Fans suspect that one of the prequels could be about Essos.
Also, HBO’s synopsis reads, &ldquo;Taking place thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones, the series chronicles the world's descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour.&rdquo;
#2 Origin of White Walkers

Remember the first ever episode of Game of Thrones from season one begins with white walkers. But how did they rise from the dead? Did the Children of The Forest had something to do with that? One of the prequels is suspected to be about this – the origin of White Walkers.
#3 The Age Of Heroes

Mentioned in the synopsis of Game Of Thrones prequels, The Age Of Heroes could be the possible subject of one of the series. This one, according to theories, will focus on the formation of Stark house. This will focus on Brandon Stark AKA Brandon the Builder, the legendary founder of the house of Stark, who build the Wall and Winterfell with the help of the giants, as people say.
Perhaps, this will also tell stories of how other houses were formed. There’ll be lot of politics, we’re sure.
Fun fact: Well, some theories also suggest that Bran Stark is actually Bran the builder. It’s getting insane, right? He is also the Night King, some say.
#4 Empire of Ash

For all those who like dragons, this one is for you all. If the theories are to be believed, this one will be set in Valyria, a ruined city in Essos, which was destroyed because of &ldquo;social, economic, and political crises&rdquo; a century before Aegon's Landing by an event called the Doom of Valyria. This one will include the story of dragons and House Targaryen, a family of dragon lords during that time.
#5 The King Beyond the Wall

This Game of Thrones prequel will be about the leader who manages to unite all the wildlings under his command to pose a threat to the seven kingdoms south of the wall. This one might show the Starks in the bad light, because it will be from the perspective of the King beyond the wall.
Also, if you’re expecting Jon Snow (Kit Harington) or Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) to be a part of the show, you should know that George RR Martin has already revealed that the prequels won’t have any of the characters from the current season. It will focus on their ancestors. So, there will not be an Iron Throne or King’s landing. Well, that’s a bummer, but we are sure it will surpass our expectation levels.
Game of Thrones prequels are likely to be released in 2020.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
