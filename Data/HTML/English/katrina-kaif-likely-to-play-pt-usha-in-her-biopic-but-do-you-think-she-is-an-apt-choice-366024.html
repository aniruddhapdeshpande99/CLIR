Katrina Kaif Likely To Play PT Usha In Her Biopic But Do You Think She Is An Apt Choice?
Most of the Bollywood actors aspire to be versatile. They want to step out of their comfort zone to experiment with roles. While sometimes it pays off, other times it goes horribly wrong.
A biopic on PT Usha, also called the queen of Indian track and field, the sprinter who has won as many as 101 international medals, the woman who had the courage to break stereotypes and follow her dreams, is being made. And guess who‚Äôll be cast in the role?
If reports are to be believed, Katrina Kaif is under consideration to the play role, and here‚Äôs what fans think about it.
When you don‚Äôt have enough money for a good casting director...

Do you think Katrina Kaif is the apt choice? Earlier, it was rumoured that Priyanka Chopra is under consideration to play the role. Maybe, Priyanka was still a better option. But this is not the first time where the choice of role for an actor has gone terribly wrong.
Mary Kom was a successful venture, but when it was revealed that Priyanka Chopra is playing the titular role, a lot of people were disappointed. Don‚Äôt you think a woman hailing from North-East India would have played the role better? That was perhaps a great opportunity for Bollywood to introduce a new face.
Why the fuck is Priyanka Chopra playing Mary Kom in the movie? Why can't they cast a North-East Indian actress? ‚Äî Mr. N (@LadyClonidine) November 5, 2012
Recently, when the posters of Anurag Kashyap‚Äôs Saand Ki Aankh were out, it just didn‚Äôt feel right. With all that make-up and prosthetics, Bhumi Pednekar and Taapsee Pannu looked so unreal in the role of the world's oldest sharpshooters. We have brilliant actors of that age who, perhaps, could have pulled this role with sheer brilliance ‚Äì like Seema Pahwa, Supriya Pathak, Surekha Sikri or Neena Gupta?
We often complaint about the dearth of Sikh men in the film industry, but we haven‚Äôt cast them in roles when required? From Akshay Kumar to Shah Rukh Khan and Ajay Devgn, men in Bollywood have played Sikh roles many times but none apart from Diljit Dosanjh in Udta Punjab aced it better than ever.
