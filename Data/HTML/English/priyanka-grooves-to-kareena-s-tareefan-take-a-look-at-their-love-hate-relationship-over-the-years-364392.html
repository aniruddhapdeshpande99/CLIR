They are counted among the top 3 actresses of Bollywood. They are every woman's inspiration and every man's desire. No Prizes for guessing, it's about the coolest duo on the block - Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Kareena Kapoor Khan.
Bebo started her career in 2000 with Refugee and joining her soon after was Priyanka in 2003 with Hero. Since then, PC-Bebo have been a sizzling topic of discussion. Whoever said actresses can't be friends have not seen the latest camaraderie the two share. But things always weren't so rosy. Here's taking a look at the changing relationship of Priyanka and Kareena over the years.
1. The two got along on the sets of Aitraaz
Priyanka and Kareena always knew of each through work and parties, but they became close only after Aitraaz. Putting the rumours that two female co-stars can't be friends, Priyanka spoke highly of her in her old interviews.
Don't Miss
&quot;I didn't have to try hard to build a rapport with Kareena, she was very sweet to me already. I have never faced any problem with her. In all the projects that we have worked on, she has been very cordial and good-natured with me. In fact, whether it was on a set while shooting for a film, or at a partyâ€”we have always gotten along, really well! I think she is really misunderstood as a person, and she is a really nice soul.&quot;
2. Kareena took a sly dig at Priyanka by calling Heroine Madhur Bhandarkar's best film
Priyanka won a national award for her role in Madhur Bhandarkar's Fashion (2003) and since then, there has been no looking back for her. However, Kareena who was later roped in for Heroine by the same director felt her movie was better. She even lashed out indirectly at PC back then when she said, &quot;Who cares about national awards?&quot;
Priyanka responded to Kareena's remarks by saying that she hasn't got the award, so sour grape, Well, the snide remarks used to be a huge deal in Bollywood back then and these two were nailing it, Take a look
