Fans Set A New Example, Slam Trolls For Racist Jibes At Director Atlee Kumar Who Was Hanging Out With Shah Rukh Khan
We are a country composed of people having diverse colour, caste, creeds and customs. India is hailed as the land of many languages and is celebrated as ethnically and culturally diverse nation. Yet, we have not been able to rise above the biases.

At an IPL match recently, at MA Chidambaram International Cricket Stadium, Shah Rukh Khan was enjoying the match between Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) along with Tamil filmmaker and screenwriter Atlee Kumar, who is known for his works in movies like Theri and Mersal among others.

A movie director was sitting next to a Bollywood star enjoying a cricket match – what could possibly go wrong here, right? But some people made racist remarks on Atlee’s skin complexion.

The fans of the 32-year-old star lashed out at the obnoxious comments being made and taught the trolls a good lesson.
Okay yes he is black! Seriously? You are making fun of his skintone? Do u guys even realise that skin tone is the real skin tone of Ancient Indians?! btw u r either watching this match in TV or from paid stands while he is sitting in a VIP area! He achieved that with his talents pic.twitter.com/i8LSqw0Shn — Sarcawesome (@mrmohanmk) April 10, 2019
May be the guys who making fun would never be known to even people in the next streets but #Atlee already made his name in Kollywood! Respect people for their talents and characters, not by their looks or gender!

Myself being mostly dark, I feel bad for the trolls that #Atlee has to go through when he makes public appearances. #Priya should be proud that her hubby has reached a height that to sit besides #SRK is no less feat. pic.twitter.com/aDsAIm8OJ2 — 🎞Pravs🎧 (@filmsnut) April 9, 2019

At the end of the day, #Atlee got married to a beautiful woman. Earning 8 figure salary. Doing movies with the biggest star of this generation in Tamil. You, his RACIAL ABUSERS, are living a low life. — George AB Addict (@VijayIsMyLife) April 9, 2019
Y’all making fun of Atlee’s skin colour well at least he got to sit beside SRK by his own hardwork. What have you achieved other than sitting at your home commenting about his skin colour? #Atlee #CSKvKKR — Yaaro 🤔 (@lostsoulheree) April 9, 2019
In the meantime, some of the fans were wondering as to Atlee Kumar and SRK’s hanging out with each other could mean a possible collaboration? Little birdies suggest Atlee Kumar is talks with Shah Rukh Khan for the remake of the latter’s 2017 film Mersal.

Although, nothing is official as of yet, people, especially movie journalists from the South are convinced about this alleged collaboration.
. @iamsrk and @Atlee_dir are certainly doing a Movie together..
Whether it's #Mersal Hindi remake or fresh script is to be decided.. — Ramesh Bala (@rameshlaus) April 9, 2019
Mersal, which starred Tamil star Vijay in the lead role, is a story about two twin brother avenging their father’s death. The movie had minted Rs 260 crore at the worldwide box-office. After Shah RukhK Khan walked out of Rakesh Sharma biopic, we wonder if he has taken up this role.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
