Looks like Chris is enjoying every moment of his visit to India. After calling India's traffic a 'sweet chaos', he enjoyed Diwali festivities and celebrations.
Along with his co-actor Randeep Hooda and director Sam Hargrave, Chris shared a video where he is seen wishing all his fans.
&ldquo;Happy Deepavali everybody. We are here in India shooting and having a wonderful day. Namaste!&quot;.
The video wasn't the highlight but he donned a kurta and that is what is really melting our hearts! Directed by Anthony Russo Dhaka will be shot in two locations - India and Indonesia. While Chris' duration of the stay in India is still a mystery, we hope he continues to enjoy his time here!
