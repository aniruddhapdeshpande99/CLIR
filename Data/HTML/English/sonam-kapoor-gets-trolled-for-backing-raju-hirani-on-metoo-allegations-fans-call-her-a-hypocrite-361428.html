I believe #TanushreeDatta and @janiceseq85 recollection of the account. Janice is my friend, and she is anything but an exaggerator or a liar. And it’s upto us to stand together. https://t.co/sF3mS5o1P8 — Sonam K Ahuja (@sonamakapoor) September 28, 2018
Not long ago, Rajkumar Hirani was accused of sexual harassment by a woman who worked with him on his 2018 movie Sanju. It was apparently the first time that a Bollywood A-lister was accused of #MeToo. Bollywood stars kept mum on this except a few including Arshad Warsi, Sharman Joshi and Raageshwari among others.
Sonam Kapoor who is busy promoting her movie Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, which has been released today, was asked about the same in one of the interviews.
&ldquo;In the Me Too movement, I always believe a woman. But in this case, we need to reserve our judgment. Two things here - one the film is as important as the movement and second, I have known Hirani for many years and I respect him as a filmmaker and a man. I will talk about it at length when the movie is released. But what if it’s (allegations) aren’t true, the movement will get derailed,&rdquo; she had said.

Sonam Kapoor's &quot;feminism&quot; is flakier than the chicken puffs sold in Malad's bakeries. At least those puffs can be enjoyed with evening tea. — Neerja | نیرجا ✨ (@neerjadeodhar) January 31, 2019

Sonam Kapoor saying she believes all women, just not when they're accusing the producer of her new film, and especially not when the film is as important as the movement, and anyway, the woman's probably lying https://t.co/SQvVaZ439T pic.twitter.com/92zwI0zdAs — Uday Bhatia (@yooday) January 30, 2019
Haha. It’s more like a matter of convinience. Shout all #Metoo until one of your loved one (Male) gets harassed by the dirty women with hidden agenda. #sonamkapoor — S Mantri (@SMantri4) January 31, 2019
