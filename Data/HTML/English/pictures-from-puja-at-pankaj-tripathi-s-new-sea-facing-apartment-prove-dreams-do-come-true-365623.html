In the interview, he bared his heart out and said that even though he now owns his dream house, but he still hasn’t forgotten about one-room shed which had a tin roof. Talking to IANS, he said,
&ldquo;Today, my wife Mridula and I own our dream house. But I haven't forgotten my one-room shed with its tin roof in Patna. One night, the rains and wind were so intense that one of the tin sheets blew away and I was left looking at the naked sky. It was our dream home, a love nest at the seaside. Now I've finally bought our dream house in Madh Island. My wife got very emotional after we shifted into our new home.&rdquo;
And now, we have pictures from the house-warming/grah pravesh puja shared by Pankaj's friends and they are precious for reasons more than one.
