PM Modiâ€™s Selfie With The Young Bollywood Brigade Gets Trolled, People Call Them â€˜A Bunch Of Cowardsâ€™
Hailed as notable young icons of the Hindi film industry, Bollywood biggies including Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Rajkummar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana, Bhumi Pednekar, Karan Johar, Rohit Shetty, Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra landed in Delhi yesterday to meet the Prime Minister of the nation Narendra Modi.
This time the meeting included women figures from the industry too â€“ that was indeed a cautionary measure considering how the meeting was criticised last time for lack of female representation.
But did this spare them from getting trolled? Not really!
It was an honour to join my fellow industry mates in this special discussion with our honourable prime minister @narendramodi ji. Thank you sir for this insightful meeting. pic.twitter.com/4c1xvsiwd4 â€” Rajkummar Rao (@RajkummarRao) January 10, 2019

Was this PMâ€™s &ldquo;planned PR&rdquo;? Well, thatâ€™s what Nafisa Ali said.
&quot;Felt sad to see my Fraternity being part of PMâ€™s planned PR ... I will pray that the truth is exposed and the closed door planning of divide & rule is understood . I worry for the Constitutional rights of every Indian . I was in Gujarat soon after the riots and will never forget the reality of what I saw . I pray for the Unity of India,&quot; she wrote.
Odisha-born academician Professor Ashok Swain, who has often voiced his opinion on a range of different issues called them all a &ldquo;bunch of cowards&rdquo;.
Why Hollywood is Hollywood, and Bollywood is Bollywood? A bunch of cowards. https://t.co/DqL6WSLNfA â€” Ashok Swain (@ashoswai) January 10, 2019

Was this really the selfie of the year?
Well, it is being compared with Ellen Degeneresâ€™ Oscar selfie that had went viral a few years ago.
Apparently, the meeting was arranged by Mahaveer Jain and Karan Johar. Thanking Modi in a post, hereâ€™s what Karan Johar wrote:
&ldquo;Powerful and timely conversations can bring about change and this was one of what we hope will become a regular conversation. Meeting the Honorable Prime Minister @narendramodi today was an incredible opportunity.
As a community, there is a huge interest to contribute to nation building. There is so much that we want to do. And can do and this dialogue was towards how and what ways we can do that. When the youngest country (in demography) joins hands with the largest movie industry in the world, we hope to be a force to reckon with. Together we would love to inspire and ignite positive changes to a transformative India.
The film industry would also like to send a huge thanks for the GST reduction in movie ticket prices that was implemented recently!
Thank you so much for your time, Sir!&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
