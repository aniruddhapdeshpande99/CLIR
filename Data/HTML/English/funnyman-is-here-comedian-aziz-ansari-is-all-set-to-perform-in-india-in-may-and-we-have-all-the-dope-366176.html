However, he responded to all the claims stating that he was surprised and concerned. Later on, he spoke about the allegations in a show in February and he clarified that he had to take time off to actually process the situation and reply privately.
He had said, &quot;It made me think about a lot, and I hope I’ve become a better person.&quot; The Road to Nowhere tour began in Boston in February and will end in July.
