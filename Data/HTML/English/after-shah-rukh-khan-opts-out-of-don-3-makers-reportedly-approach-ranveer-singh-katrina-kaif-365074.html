And now, the grapevine is abuzz with rumours that Shah Rukh Khan has also opted out of the movie.
It is said that after Shah Rukh Khan opted out of the movie citing personal problems, Producer Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar‘s banner Excel Entertainment has approved Ranveer Singh for the role. It is also said that Katrina Kaif has been approached to play the leading lady.
We are sure that Ranveer will ace the role, but why has SRK opted out? Well, that remains a mystery. Little birdies, however, suggest that it all happened after SRK and PC’s fallout.
Rumour has it that Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra were dating at one point in time. PC is said to have appeared on a US chat show in ex-beau SRK's leather jacket and boy, it caught people’s attention. It is said that after their fallout, they decided not to work with each other.
