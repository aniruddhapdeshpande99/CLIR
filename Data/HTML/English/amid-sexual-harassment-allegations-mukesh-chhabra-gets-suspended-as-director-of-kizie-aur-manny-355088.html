Fox Star India
&quot;As a responsible organization, Star India takes any allegation of sexual harassment of women at workplace very seriously. Hence, Fox Star Studios has suspended the services of Mukesh Chhabra, director of our film Kizie Aur Manny, which is under production, till the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of M/s Mukesh Chhabra Casting Company concludes its inquiry into the allegations against him.&quot;
After casting for films like Gangs Of Wasseypur, Kai Po Che!, D-Day and Highway, this was going to be Chhabra's big break as a film director. The allegations made on Chhabra were published in a leading daily but he dismissed the claims by calling them &quot;unsubstantiated wild anonymous allegations&quot;.
