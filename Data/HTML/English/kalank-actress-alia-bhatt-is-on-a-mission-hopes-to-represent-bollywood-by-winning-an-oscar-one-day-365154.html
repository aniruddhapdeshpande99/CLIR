We met Alia for an interaction where we spoke about her upcoming film Kalank and lot more. Looking a little dull due to being unwell, she still happily answered all the questions.
Firstly, we asked her about her upcoming Kalank comparison with Sanjay Leela Bhansali films, to which she said &ldquo;We expected it because I don’t think anyone has touched this world except Bhansali sir. Abhishek is very inspired by Sanjay sir’s work, but it is a very different film, while the look of the film looks similar, the world is his own world, I think it’s a great thing, also I feel Abhishek will take it as a compliment.&rdquo;

Alia also said Kalank was not an easy project, it was taxing and took a toll over her, &ldquo; I wouldn’t say Kalank was fun and game, because it was not, -it was a taxing and intense experience but it was very rich in challenging, it was not like we were angry on sets. The feeling was like okay, I really worked hard and earned my sleep for that night.&rdquo;
Twitter
She clarified, &ldquo;What took a toll on me was that I was working on Kalank and Brahmastra at the same time, nowadays you are not just doing movies you are doing ads and lots of things, so I have been working constantly. Last year I didn’t have a single day off for me&rdquo;.
When asked why doesn’t she slow down with her career and she replies, &ldquo; I thought of it that I did 3 films last year and I can’t, so I should just slow, but this year I am doing 4 films, so it’s just that I don’t learn from my own thinking. Point is that I want to do it, and why should I slow down? I will slow down when I need to.&rdquo;
Alia is right now the most talked about and bankable actress. Everyone is praising her or eyeing her work, when we asked her if it affects her and she has a zen like answer ready,
&ldquo; The world only exists the day you opened your eyes, what appears in front of me is only what I choose to look at, so whatever chatter happens about me whether it is positive or negative, I don’t pay too much attention to it, when people say good things I obviously feel wow and if people say not so good things I am okay, they don’t feel a certain way, so it’s fine, I have a very like Buddha attitude to all of it. I anyway have so much attention going around me, I am trying to do so much more with my every character and film, I am a producer now, I am doing other social things, so one person can think of only these many things at a time and I also have family and friends to think about so I don’t really pay attention to chatter around me.&rdquo;
Reaching this high was definitely Alia’s dream,
&ldquo;I don’t know if I thought it but I definitely hoped it, I have always hoped and dreamt big and not like unimaginable big but yaa I hope to win an Oscar someday.&rdquo; We totally back her on this.
Twitter
When asked if she is expecting National Award for Raazi, she said, &ldquo;Last time also, I was told that I will get it for Udta Punjab but nothing happened, so I don’t want people to tell me until it comes to me.&rdquo;
Twitter
Lastly we quizzed her if she became more careful after Shaandaar failure and she clarified, &ldquo; Even with Shaandaar, I loved the script but through the film making process the script changed and that’s what went wrong with the film, it started with A and ended with E, I had the same process before and after Shaandaar, but it has given ability to become aware, and if your instincts say it wrong you say it, that’s what it thought me, to always say what I am feeling even if maybe back short or push down but say it because your indicts is always right.&rdquo;
Alia Bhatt is undoubtedly one of the best actresses we have in B-town right now and here's hoping she continues to be one.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
