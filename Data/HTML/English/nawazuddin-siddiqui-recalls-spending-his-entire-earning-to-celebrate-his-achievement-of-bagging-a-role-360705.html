&ldquo;The happiness was short lived as I had to share half the money with one of the co-ordinators since I didn’t have a junior artiste card. From what was left, I spent Rs 1800 at a hotel to celebrate my achievement and then took a rickshaw ride. By the end of it, I was penniless again,&rdquo; he said.

He also revealed that he once decided to sell coriander that he bought for Rs 200 from a wholesaler to earn profit, but a tragedy happened. He said that the leaves were turning brown and no one would buy it from him.
&ldquo;I confronted the seller, who explained that I should have sprinkled water on the leaves to keep them fresh. The advice came too late and it was money down the drain.&rdquo;
