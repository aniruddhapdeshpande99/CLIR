At a recent event in Mumbai, when Singh was asked about marrying Padukone, he had a wide grin on his face. He went on to describe how 'magical' it is to marry the person you love. While this might just make you feel a little more #ForeverAlone, it might also give you a completely new perspective on marriage.

&ldquo;I feel like I am flying, Marriage is like the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me. Wow, I feel some kind of magic, some kind of power, I feel invincible, you know in superhero movies, that moment when the suit comes on, I feel like marriage has done that to me. I feel like Iâ€™ve grown up now, finally, I am a man. I feel grounded, I feel secure. Iâ€™m really loving it, itâ€™s been only 10 or 15 days, itâ€™s so nice, itâ€™s so lovely. I would highly recommend it.&rdquo;
That's not all. In his latest interview with Filmfare magazine, Singh opened up about his relationship with Deepika and confessed that he was ready for marriage three years ago but he was waiting for her to be ready and give a final nod.
