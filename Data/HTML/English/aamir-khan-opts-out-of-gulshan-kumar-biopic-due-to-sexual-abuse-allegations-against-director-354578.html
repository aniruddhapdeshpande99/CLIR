Subhash Kapoor, on the entire incident, says that he respects Aamir Khan for his decision, and he will prove his point in the court of law.
&ldquo;I understand and respect Aamir Khan’s and Kiran Rao’s decision. Since matter is subjudice, I intend to prove my innocence in the court of law. But I do want to raise a question – is secretly filming a crying woman without her consent and knowledge and uploading it on social media not harassment or abuse? Or is it fine if she is related to someone who is &ldquo;accused&rdquo; of a misconduct. If your answer is latter then for me it’s nothing less than a khaap panchayat mentality,&rdquo; he said as quoted by Indian Express.
And now, Ekta Kapoor has also cut all professional ties with the director. According to a report in Mid-day, Ekta has sacked Subhash as the showrunner of her forthcoming web series, The Verdict.
&quot;After Ekta came on board as one of the core committee members of the Producers' Guild that aims to address the issue of sexual harassment at workplace, it was brought to her notice that Subhash has an ongoing case against him. Ekta immediately decided to remove him from the show.&quot; Director Shashwat Shah will manage the production in view of the latest development. &quot;A new showrunner will be brought on board soon,&quot; a source revealed to the publication.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
