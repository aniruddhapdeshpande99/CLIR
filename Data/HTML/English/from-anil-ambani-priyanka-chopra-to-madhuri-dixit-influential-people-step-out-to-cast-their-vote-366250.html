While these celebs have cast their votes, there are others including Alia Bhatt, Soni Razdan, Akshay Kumar, Jacqueline Fernandez, Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif among others who wouldn’t be able to vote in these elections. These celebs do not hold Indian citizenship, and hence, can’t vote.
Voting is underway for the 17 Lok Sabha constituencies in Maharashtra.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
