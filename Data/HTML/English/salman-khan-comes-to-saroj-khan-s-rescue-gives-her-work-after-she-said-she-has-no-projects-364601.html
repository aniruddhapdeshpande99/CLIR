For the uninitiated, Saroj Khan and Salman Khan had a fallout during Andaz Apna Apna. It is said that Salman felt that Saroj Khan favoured Aamir over him. It was during the Ganpati celebrations in 2018 that the two let the bygones be bygones and buried the hatchet. Salman even obliged to meet her grandson, an ardent fan of Salman, when he was keeping unwell.
She had even said Sanjay Leela Bhansali didn’t pay him for Ram Leela, replaced her and stole her steps. She said that she was told the song was scrapped because Salman Khan didn’t like the song because there was a line from Dabangg in the song. She said she was promised she will be called for the new song, but then she was replaced.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
