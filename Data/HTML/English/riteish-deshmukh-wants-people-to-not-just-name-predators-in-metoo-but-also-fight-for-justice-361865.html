&ldquo;I just feel that it (the movement) has started, which is fantastic, but I think it also needs to figure out a way so that it can find its way to justice, beyond just naming a person and saying that this is what it is. I think people also get lost as to how to take it forward. Be it court, police or whatever, one needs to figure out a way so that there’s certain justice given,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by Indian Express.
After Sajid Khan was accused of sexual harassment, Riteish Deshmukh had tweeted, &ldquo;Deeply disturbing to hear and read the news of so many women who had to go through these incidents of harassment in various fields. I think it’s extremely brave of every woman to have shared their stories. All need to be heard and not judged. I stand with them today. #MeToo.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
