Not just that, back then, she gave up on IIT Kanpur because she wanted to pursue a career in acting. &ldquo;I got through IIT Kanpur, but opted for arts in college, as my parents felt that pursing engineering along with an acting career would be difficult. But the film was so popular that leading a regular life in college became difficult. So I studied from home for my bachelors and masters,&rdquo; she had earlier said in an interview with TOI.

Papa Kehte Hia, however, was not her first film. Mayoori had made her debut with National Award winning film Naseem, and later went on to do films including Papa Kehte Hain, Betaabi, Hogi Pyaar Ki Jeet, Badal and Papa the Great. In 2003, she got married to NRI Aditya Dhillon and moved to the US, where she also completed her MBA in marketing and finance from City University of New York-Baruch College – Zicklin School of Business. Before coming back to Gurugram, she even worked in the US for quite some time.
