The figurine has been unveiled today at the wax museum. The statue was initially scheduled to be revealed on February 28 but was postponed in the wake of mourning over the Pulwama terror attack.
Ahead of the release of his figurine, Diljit shared the news with his pic on Instagram. &quot;Tomorrow #Madametussauds Dosanjhanwala in DELHI TOMORROW Nu LOVE MY FANS @madametussauds@madametussaudsdelhi,&quot;he captioned the post.
The ‘Udta Punjab’ actor had earlier said that amidst rising tensions between India and Pakistan, he would stand with the Indian Army and thus will reschedule the unveiling of his statue.
