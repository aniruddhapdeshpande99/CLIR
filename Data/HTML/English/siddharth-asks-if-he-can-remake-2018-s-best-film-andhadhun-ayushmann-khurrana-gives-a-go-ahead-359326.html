Siddharth And Ayushmann Khurrana Are Jamming Over Andhadun & We Might Get To See A Remake Soon!
2018 proved that content is king in Bollywood. The fact that the films like Andhadhun and Badhai Ho won hearts and films of the Khans – Race 3, Thugs Of Hindostan and Zero – failed miserably at the box office – proves that audiences are demanding a change and they can’t be fooled with masala entertainers anymore. Scriptwriters are finally getting their due.

Who would have imagined that a film like Andhadhun, which wasn’t promoted extensively, would do wonders at the box office! The Ayushmann Khurrana movie received immense love from the audiences as well as critics. So much so, that it has been named as the best film of 2018 by IMDb.
It has been more than 100 days since the movie was released, and it is still playing in cinema halls.
And now actor Siddharth, who is known for his stellar performances in films such as Andhadhun, wants a South Indian remake of the movie.
