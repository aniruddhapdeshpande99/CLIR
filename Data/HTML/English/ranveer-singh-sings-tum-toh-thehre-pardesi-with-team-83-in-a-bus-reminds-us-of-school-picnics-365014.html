Ranveer Singh Sings ‘Tum Toh Thehre Pardesi’ With Team 83 In A Bus, Reminds Us Of School Picnics!
We have seen Ranveer Singh playing totally different kind of roles in every film. From Alauddin Khilji, Simmba to Gully Boy, Ranveer has proved that he is here for the long haul. In his next, however, he has taken up the biggest professional challenge, which is to master Kapil Dev’s bowling action for his biopic titled 83.
The shooting of the film has begun. The man is training with legendary cricketer Kapil Dev himself.
Team 83 is currently in Dharamshala brushing up their cricket skills. No brownie points for guessing how excited Ranveer Singh is for the movie. For this one as well, his energy quotient is higher than ever and looks like the energy bug has bitten others too.
In one of the videos doing the rounds, team 83 can be seen singing ‘tum toh thehre pardesi’ on top of their voice. Take a look!

They are in a bus, perhaps post their practice session. Doesn’t it remind you of the everyday bus ride from school? We all have done this during picnics, for sure.
But that’s not all. How can Ranveer Singh not sing Apna Time Ayega, right? Once again, he rapped like a pro!
These are all memories that they are making. Deepika Padukone thinks exactly the same. She left an adorable comment on one of the pictures that Ranveer Singh had posted.
But how did you all manage to save so much energy post training session?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
