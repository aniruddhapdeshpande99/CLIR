&ldquo;We want to tell a story about the world of music and fresh voices in sound on the Indian scene. And through that, a take on urban relationships that don’t necessarily mean love and marriage and happily ever after. The worlds explored here are deeper than surface level - heart, hurt, passion, and above all - music.&quot;
The makers are taking the film Begin Again as an opportunity to create music that is the most important element of the film.
