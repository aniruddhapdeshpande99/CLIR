Emilia Clarke aka Khaleesi, recently released unseen photographs taken during her recovery from a life-threatening brain aneurysm in 2011, when she was just 24-years-old. This was also the first when the first season of Game Of Thrones released.
Earlier this year, the star opened up about how she suffered and survived two brain aneurysms while filming the fantasy drama, the second of which nearly killed her. And this time she shared images from her hospital stay.

Discussing the impact it had not just on her physical health but mental well-being, in an interview, she said: &quot;The first time it was difficult, with the second one I found it much harder to stay optimistic. (I coped with it as a) a day-to-day thing. I definitely went through a period of being... down - putting it mildly.&quot;
In one of the photographs, the actor is lying on a hospital bed holding her phone and in the other, the star is with a medical tube attached to her head.

The actress explained that when a part of your brain is starved of blood for more than a minute, it dies, which is what happened to her after her second aneurysm.
She said that once she returned to shoot the second season she had no time to &quot;question her own mortality&quot; because she was too busy playing a &quot;bada*s character who walked through fire&quot;.
