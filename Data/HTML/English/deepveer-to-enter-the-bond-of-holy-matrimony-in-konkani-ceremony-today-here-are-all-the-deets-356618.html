After dating for over six years, Bollywood's most graceful and popular couple Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone are all set to tie the knot today at Lake Como in Italy.
Security at both venues is on a par with that provided for a meeting of world leaders. At the CastaDiva resort, for instance, any and all guests or visitors have to present a special wristband while security guards cover up the camera lenses on mobile phones with stickers.
