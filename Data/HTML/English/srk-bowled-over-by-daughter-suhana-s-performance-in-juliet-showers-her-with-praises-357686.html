Calling it a ‘wonderful experience’, he conveyed his good wishes to the other members of the cast, calling their acts ‘exceptional’.

With this message, he shared a collage of Suhana on the poster of the play. The other half of the collage has a picture of Daddy Khan with Suhana, where he is seen hugging her with a bouquet.
Just to jog your memory a little, this isn't the first time that SRK is impressed with the daughter's acting skills. Last year in February, a video of Suhana's school play went viral on the internet and SRK himself praised her for her skills.
Suhana made headlines this year after she was featured on the cover of Vogue. While the pictures went viral, it also sparked controversy around her credibility and privilege.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
