However, with more and more impending projects, this one kept taking a backseat.
There were several rumors that claimed how actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Irrfan Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone and many others were approached but nothing could work out! And now, a Mumbai Mirror report hints that Bhansali has finally found his lead pair for the project. The report claims that Manmarziyan actors Taapsee Pannu and Abhishek Bachchan will star in the film and it'll be directed by Jasmeet Reen.
A source has been quoted in the report saying,

&quot;Both Abhishek and Taapsee have loved the story and are looking forward to collaborate again. However, they are yet to sign on the dotted line. One the formalities are locked, they will begin prep.&quot;
Taapsee will be playing the role of novelist Amrita Pritam.
