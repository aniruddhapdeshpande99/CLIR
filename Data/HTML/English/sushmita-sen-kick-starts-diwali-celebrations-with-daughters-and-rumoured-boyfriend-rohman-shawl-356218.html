It's a festival that brings people closer. For many lucky ones, this festival becomes even more special if they're around their families and loved ones. For Sushmita Sen, this Diwali is indeed super special.
Apart from her daughters who light up her world, there is a latest addition in her family, who is making her happier than ever and shine like a goddess.
You might be living under a rock if you are not aware of this person who has entered Sush's life and making her blush and happy these days. While both have continued to maintain graceful silence over the same, their PDA and outings have said it all.

Her rumoured boyfriend Rohman Shawl has been spending the Diwali week with her and Sushmita has kind of introduced him on social media as well
