The actress who had spoken about it 10 years ago as well, once again claimed that she was sexually harassed by Nana Patekar on the sets of a film, but since nobody believed her story and her voice was curbed, she had to quit the industry.

Now, Tanushree Dutta is bringing Bollywood’s sexual harassment stories to screen with her upcoming short film titled Inspiration, which will be released on March 8 to mark International Women’s Day, claim reports.
The movie will be released online. It will deal with the issue of &ldquo;wilful exploitation of young newcomers in showbiz&rdquo; apart from other fields. Tanushree Dutta said it is going to be new &ldquo;reality meets fiction&rdquo; format, she told Mid Day.
Tanushree Dutta is currently in New Jersey but she is making sure that the talks about #MeToo isn’t dying down anytime soon.
