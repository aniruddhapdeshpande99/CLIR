While no one from Bollywood could make a cut in their guest-list, their wedding was exactly how it should have been about them and their family. If we talk about family, just like Ranveer, who is popular for being an enthu-cutlet, looks like his Dad Jagjit Singh Bhavnani is also as filmy as his son!

Even though we all were far away from their celebrations in Italy, we did get all the updates-thanks to social media. From stalking Ranveer-Deepika's team on social media to waiting for their official pictures with bated breath, here is all that we loved about the #DeepVeer wedding (Clearly the most hashtagged event of the year)
Deepika looked every bit beautiful as a Sabyasachi bride. The moment DP’s pictures as the bride were out, our eyes went on her huge engagement ring. The rectangular shaped solitaire on Deepika’s hand has left everyone talking and estimating the worth of it. As per reports online, the price of the ring is between 1.3- 2.7 crore gifted to her by hubby Ranveer.
What didn't come as a surprise was how netizens reacted to these pictures. While half of them couldn't stop gushing and sulking about their single status, there were a few people who tweaked the pictures only to start a meme-fest.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
