Remember how we used to have MASSIVE debates over FoE being killed?
Where is the intolerance? @AnupamPKher used to mock those complaining.
Now there is no debate, now it's open, brazen, unabashed.
Kar Lo Jo Kar Sakte Ho attitude.

&quot;Many of you may not know that this retrospective will be the last show decided by the advisory committee of local artists and not by some bureaucrat or an agent of the government with an agenda of either moral policing or proliferation of certain art commensurate with an ideological incline,&quot; Amol Palekar said referring to news reports.

Veteran Actor and Film Maker Amol Palekar being rudely cut off and asked to shut up just because he was mildly critical of Ministry of Culture. There is no Intolerance. Only sycophancy is tolerated pic.twitter.com/pFN6rhQ1g9 ‚Äî Joy (@Joydas) February 9, 2019
No matter who you vote, what happened to Amol Palekar today is most shameful.
Right wingers will give a shit.
And well liberals I have no hopes from, honestly.
But my heart cries. What a gentleman he is. And how rudely that lady spoke. ‚Äî richa singh (@richa_singh) February 9, 2019
Shocking this video is from @mumbai_ngma , actor Amol palekar was not allowed to speak. This what intolerance is. @sardesairajdeep @sagarikaghose @BDUTT https://t.co/6IRfzofzbp ‚Äî Ashish Joshi (@SolutionsJoshi) February 9, 2019
Even more shameful is that there were people in audience who apparently support art, culture, films and allowed Amol Palekar to be humiliated like this by Sycophants of Government https://t.co/6Edu0W724u ‚Äî Joy (@Joydas) February 9, 2019
Is this how a veteran actor and a man of Amol Palekar‚Äôs stature treated? That video was difficult to watch. ‚Äî Rituparna Chatterjee (@MasalaBai) February 10, 2019
