Indiatimes had a conversation with Arunoday, where he spoke about how 2018 has been one learning year for him.
He first began the interview by saying, &ldquo;Life is wonderful, I don’t know if I did something to deserve this, but I am sure I must have done something.&rdquo;
Nothing Has Changed In Bollywood
We quizzed Arunoday, if things are changing for actors now and if it's the best time for them to be in the business, to which he said, &ldquo; I think I have been told this when I first started, which was 10 years ago that now is a great time. Then after 5 years, I was told the same thing and even till date i hear the same thing. I have continuously worked so I can say things haven’t really changed much, they are on the way, but the money is still very firmly there in the star system, that hasn’t changed at all, there is always the hope that it does change, but it will only change when quality filmmakers continue to work with quality actors regardless of thinking about the success of the project. Like if a director does very well, and his next film has to be with big stars or with big production, that’s something that has to be changed.&rdquo;

Successful Actors Are Not Happy Like Me
When asked why even today stars get opportunity to make 10 more films despite failures, while actors like him still struggle to get good work, he said, &ldquo;That’s life, people have different avenues that they have to live in. I have worked with very successful actors who have got all the opportunities and success but they are not as happy as I am. They go through a different kind of stress. I don’t think about all this. It was my dream to become an actor, and today I am getting paid for it, what more can I want? It is very unhealthy to think about what you haven’t got. The better way is to just deal with it.&rdquo;

He Had Come To Become A Star
&quot;I had come here to become a star, but I think humility and realism got to me 10 years ago and I know for a fact that even if you get everything you dream about, it will not necessarily make you happy. The success that I am chasing is a well-settled mind, and a generally content joyful home, everything else may come and go. I have seen very unsuccessful people who are very happy with themselves and are just fine, and I have seen absolutely wealthy people who are miserable and do all sort of drugs to just make them happy. Life is strict at everyone. When I had come, I wanted to be very famous, wining and dining under the same roof with Amitabh Bachchan, but today I am quite happy the way things are progressing for me.&quot;

Learning From 2018
2018 been amazingly full of lessons. I have learned that success is not easy to come. Early success would have ruined me, I would have been a first class asshole, I like myself more now than when I started. It’s been the journey where I needed to be on. One thing that I learnt this year is that I genuinely should believe myself and my guts. I have calculated a lot while taking up other projects, but I went with my guts when I chose Blackmail and Apaharan and it has paid me off, so I will start listening to my guts. Also, I have learned I should better listen to my wife. So there is no stress now, I will listen to my gut and my wife, my decision making has become easy now.&quot;
Impact of #MeToo Movement and Learning From It
&quot;I have not grown up in Bombay and in the industry. I used to hear stories now and then but I didn’t realise how widespread it was, when I saw the MeToo Movement get started, I realised it’s exactly the thing that needs to happen. India is in a very strange place when it comes to its opinion on sexuality, relationships between men and women, power dynamics etc, I think we have the potential to become a very great nation. I don’t want MeToo movement to die and it should get more widespread now.&quot;
