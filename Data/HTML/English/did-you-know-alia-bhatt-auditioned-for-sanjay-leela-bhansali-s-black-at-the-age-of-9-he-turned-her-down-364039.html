Did You Know Alia Bhatt Auditioned For Sanjay Leela Bhansali‚Äôs ‚ÄòBlack‚Äô At The Age Of 9 & He Turned Her Down?
The young girl when quivered her fingers in order to flirt with the first snow of the season, left everyone in awe.
Ayesha Kapur, who played the role of physically challenged girl Michelle McNally, was just 10 years old when she starred in Sanjay Leela Bhansali‚Äôs iconic movie Black. The actress became an instant sensation in the world of films.

But did you know that Alia Bhatt also went for the audition of the movie when she was just nine years old? Sanjay Leela Bhansali recently told Mumbai Mirror, that she had a sparkle in her eyes when she came for the audition with her mother Soni Razdan. Looking at her, in that moment, SLB knew she would one day become a star, and hence, he refused to audition her for a child‚Äôs role.
Years later, Sanjay Leela Bhansali prediction indeed came true. Rising above the nepotism controversy with her sheer talent, Alia Bhatt has proved her mettle as an actress with some amazing roles in films such as Highway, Raazi and Gully Boy among others. And now, after years, she has finally bagged a role in the ace filmmaker‚Äôs movie titled Inshallah, which also stars Salman Khan in the lead role.

For Alia Bhatt, it is like a dream come true. &ldquo;I was 9 when I first walked into Sanjay Leela Bhansali's office, all nervous and hoping and praying that I would be in his next film. It's been a long wait,&rdquo; she had tweeted after making the announcement of the movie.
