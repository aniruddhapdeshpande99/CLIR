Crossing 600 Crore Mark At The Box Office, 2.0 Beats Padmaavat & Sanju To Become Highest Grosser Of 2018
At 4 am in Chennai, right before the first show, it seemed it was Diwali as Rajinikanth fans celebrated the release of his movie 2.0 like it was the grandest festival of all. The audiences waited for eight years for the sequel of Robot. The makers took three years to perfect VFX and visual effects. So, how was the outcome?
Minting Rs 600 crores at the global box office, Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar starrer 2.0 has beaten Sanju and Padmaavat to become the highest grosser of 2018.
So far, Rajkumar Hirani’s Sanju, which starred Ranbir Kapoor in the role of Sanjay Dutt, was the biggest blockbuster of the year at the global box office. The movie had hinted 586.85 crore. Next on the list was Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmaavat, which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in lead roles, by earning Rs 585 crore at the worldwide box office.
Smashing the records of both the movies, Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar starrer 2.0 has minted about Rs 623 crore, according to a Times Now report.
The movie garnered a lot of hype even before its release. Ardent Rajinikanth fans compared it to Baahubali only to say 2.0 is any day better than the SS Rajamouli’s magnum opus.

Waiting for 3.0 ✌ #2Point0Review — Shaik Abdul Rehaman (@sabdulrehamani) November 29, 2018
Why are Directors from Southern India succeeding in large scale films where Directors in Mumbai are failing? Directors from the South certainly show far more passion in their film making. Like in #Bahubali #Bahubali2 #2Point0 — Shekhar Kapur (@shekharkapur) December 12, 2018
