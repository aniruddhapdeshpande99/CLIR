Bollywood actress Rakhi Sawant is known for being a motormouth. For the past couple of years, she was silent before she discovered Instagram and then all hell broke loose. People who follow her on social media know the hilarious and provoking videos she puts on. Take a quick look.
Bollywood celebrities like Ranveer Singh, Taapsee, Masaba Gupta and Fatima Sana Shaikh follow her and are entertained by her videos. This time around, Rakhi resurfaced back into news after Tanushree Dutta put sexual harassment allegations on Nana Patekar.
The incident that happened during a movie set (Horn Ok Pleassss) during the shooting of an item song shook the entire nation after Tanushree claimed that Nana Patekar harassed her in 2009.

In one of the videos, Rakhi says she would file a defamation case against Tanushree. Here's why.
But this time, Rakhi took it too far. After her explosive videos on social media, Rakhi called the media for a press conference and said the most outrageous things ever. Listen in.
