Anupam Kher Admits He ‘Wrongly Judged’ Former PM Manmohan Singh, Says ‘History Will Not Misjudge’ Him
&ldquo;Hazaaron Jawabon Se Acchi Hai Meri Khamoshi, Na Jaane Kitne Sawaalon Ki Aabru Rakhe&rdquo; – Manmohan Singh
Anupam Kher, who has been quite open about his views on politics has often dissed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Remember his viral speech on intolerance in India with which he created a storm on social media? It was quite a goosebump-inducing speech, wasn't it?

Where were you when he was the prime minister? Why didn’t you make the movie that time? Who you r trying to impress now? — Naveen (@dhingra_naveen) October 26, 2018
1 thing is for sure... everyone knows that you and team @narendramodi has made this film to show Manmohan Singh as bad pm. be sure if you have done such things and u try to release film before general elections then it will be negative impact on your master's vote. — gopal parekh (@gopalparekh) October 27, 2018
As long as you portrayed him as the most honest man in Indian politics then it’s all good. — Ricky (@ricky703ca) October 26, 2018
He was less of a pm and more of a maid @gandhi's — D.R Saini (@DRSaini18) October 27, 2018
