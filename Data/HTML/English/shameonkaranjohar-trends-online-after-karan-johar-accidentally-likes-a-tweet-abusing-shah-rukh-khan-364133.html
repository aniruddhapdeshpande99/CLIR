Karan Johar, accidentally liked a tweet abusing Shah Rukh Khan while praising Akshay Kumar and his recently released movie Kesari. He unliked the tweet later on, but it was too late because a lo of fans had already taken a screenshot of it.
Twitter
In India, celebrities are considered as demi-gods, and all of them have a massive fan following who often abuse other celebs on social media. When Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan were at loggerheads, fan clubs were fighting among themselves.
So, when Karan Johar liked this tweet, Shah Rukh Khan fans were quick to spot it. The hate-game began thereafter. So much so, that #ShameOnKaranJohar was trending on Twitter with about 22,000 people tweeting using the hashtag.

This fucking snake. I think he forgot to switch accounts. Pretty sure he had got a hate account. #ShameOnKaranJohar â€” endgame (@loki_odinson_6) March 22, 2019
Karan Johar soon issued a clarification.
Guys having a technical problem with my twitter account! Strange things are going on!from uploading shoe picture and gibberish to liking tweets I havenâ€™t even read and would NEVER even acknowledge! Please bear with me and I apologise for any inconvenience! Sorting it out asap! â€” Karan Johar (@karanjohar) March 22, 2019
Aaj twitter pe thodi gadbad ho gayi but baaki sab #firstclass hai. ðŸ™ˆ â€” Karan Johar (@karanjohar) March 22, 2019
Guess what! The controversy was so big that even Shah Rukh Khan responded to it!
I hate clarifications on SM. @karanjohar is technologically challenged but has other good qualities like his taste in clothes!?Just like Life, twitter doesnâ€™t come with instructions, so mistakes r natural....& also he has fat fingers. Go easy all, Make Lov not War...itâ€™s more fun â€” Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) March 22, 2019
