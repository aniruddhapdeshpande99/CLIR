Hardik Pandya doesn’t really ask a woman her name when he meets her and no, he doesn’t get lost in a conversation with her. &ldquo;It’s not talking. It’s just watching,&rdquo; he says.
Not just this, he made many more sexist comments on the Koffee With Karan. Like - &ldquo;When I lost my virginity, I came home and said, ‘Main karke aya hai aaj' (I had sex today)&rdquo;.
When host Karan Johar asked them both – KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya – how they take a decision when both of them like the same person, KL Rahul said it’s &ldquo;Up to the woman&rdquo;. That’s when Pandya interrupted and said, &ldquo;Nahi nahi aisa kuch nahi hai, talent pe hota hai. Jisko mila woh leke jao. It is on talent.&rdquo;
Now, ex Bigg Boss contestant Priya Malik who is also known for her slam poetry slammed Hardik Pandya with her powerful poetry. In the 2.40-minute long video, Priya schooled &ldquo;Dear Mister Player&rdquo; on respecting women on how &quot;rampant misogyny&quot; is not &quot;cool&quot;. Take a look!
