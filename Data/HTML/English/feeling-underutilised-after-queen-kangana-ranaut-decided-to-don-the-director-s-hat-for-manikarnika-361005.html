One of her most loved films was Queen. In the movie, she played the lovable character of Rani who goes on her honeymoon alone after her fiancé calls off their wedding. But did you know that Kangana Ranaut started to feel underutilised as an actress after she did this movie?
In an interview to Bombay Times, she said, &ldquo;After Queen (2014), I started to feel absolutely underutilised, and I had already decided that I wanted to direct.&rdquo;
For the uninitiated, Kangana Ranaut directed a short film titled The Touch in 2012. It has been reported that the shooting of Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi started with Krish Jagarlamudi as the director. But he left midway due to creative differences reportedly, and then Kangana Ranaut took over.
Starring Kangana as Rani Laxmi Bai, Manikarnika: Queen Of Jhansi has been released today, on Jan 25.
