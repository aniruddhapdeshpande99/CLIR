We see the glamorous side that is telecast - weather it's Love School, Splitsvilla, Bigg Boss, Power Couple or celebrity Swayamvar; but reality shows are nightmare for people featuring in it. The controversial Rakhi Sawant, who is a constant in many reality shows, feels nothing you see on TV is true. She was one of the first contestants to be shortlisted for Bigg Boss season 1 and even kick-started the Swayamvar series.
Speaking about the dark side of reality TV, Rakhi says, &quot;In real, we lead a very simple life but because I end up screaming or creating controversy on TV, people think I am like that outside TV too whereas it's the script or what the show demands. My mom and sister are widows, my brother is not too successful, I'm not married or have a normal life only because people end up going on my YouTube videos or reality shows and judge me as a person. These shows have definitely taken a toll on my personal life but what to do I have to make money as well.&quot;
Well, the controversial queen is usually smirked and mocked at, but Rakhi Sawant explains that these are choices she has made only to entertain her fan base.
So here's taking a look at 14 insanely dark things in a reality show that will shake you up.
1. Pratyusha Banerjee's death
Twitter
Pratyusha Banerjee was a nation's favourite, and that's not because she featured in Balika Vadhu, but because the audience got a chance to vote for her. Yes, when the show took an age leap, three faces were finalised and the fans were given an opportunity to pick their favourite. That's how Pratyusha made the cut. However, after filming for the show for a couple of years, Pratyusha took a backseat and quit abruptly. She, instead, opted for Bigg Boss and then swiftly moved to another reality show, Power Couple. This was when people got a sneak-peek into her personal life. Pratyusha was seen dating Rahul Raj Singh. The duo shared a great camaraderie, however, the reality show clearly is far from real. The minute, the couple was evicted, the fights began and they broke up. Without dwelling too much on her past, let's just say the actress committed suicide and blamed her boyfriend for it. Now who could tell looking at the show, that something so big was fuming inside her?

2. Rahul Mahajan and Dimpy Ganguly's wedding resulted in a divorce
Dimpy Ganguly took a leap of faith and came all the way from Kolkata to Mumbai to participate in the reality show, where you end up getting MARRIED. That's right, while she knew what she was signing up for, she clearly didn't know what future had in store for her. Competing with 16 other girls, Dimpy was finally the chosen one for Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega. However, soon after they tied the knot on national television, trouble began. A couple of months into their marriage, Dimpy walked out of Rahul Mahajan's house with bruises on her hand and leg. She claimed Rahul had physically abused her. For the uninitiated, this was not the first time Rahul Mahajan had been blamed. In his previous marriage to a pilot too, the divorce resulted due to his lifestyle and wife-beater attitude. And so, the second marriage too came to a close. After they parted ways, the duo got a chance to meet in the Bigg Boss house, but thankfully, better sense prevailed and they just became friends.
3. So far, 14 couples have broken up after Bigg Boss got over
Ever since the biggest reality show began, contestants knew the only way to sustain inside the show was to create a love angle. While some genuinely fell in love - like Sky and Pooja Bedi - and lasted for quite a while outside the house too, many others like Gauahar-Kushal, Veena Malik-Ashmit Patel, Anup Jalota-Jasleen Matharu , Anupama-Aarya, Monica Bedi-Rahik Mahajan, Tanisha Mukerji-Armaan Kohli lasted till their respective seasons got over. Every season started a relationship and ended it too.
4. Karisma and Upen Patel called off their engagement after a fantastic season of Love School
Karisma Tanna and Upen Patel went a step ahead. They took on three reality shows - Bigg Boss, Love School and Nach Baliye. Their love story started on the sets of Bigg Boss and went on conveniently till the time it could get them projects as a pair. Upen, in fact, even proposed to Karisma, might I add on national television, and Karisma said yes. But like we have mentioned, what you see is not always the truth, especially on TV shows. The minute the show got over, their relationship also ended. The two agreed they were very different individuals. Well...
5. Splitsvilla sets a new benchmark in vulgarity every year
MTV/Splitsvilla
We all know how Splitsvilla is trying to blend into the milieu and go to any extent to prove its uber-cool television status. Ever since Sunny Leone and Rannvijay Singha have started hosting the reality show, we have noticed a shocking breed of boys and girls. They go extreme lengths to woo the audience and to survive the show. The above snap is one tiny example of what goes inside a 30-minute weekly show. Some contestants have admitted to not enjoying it, but still continuing in the hope of getting more work from MTV.
6. As per a Quora report, 75% of the winning amount goes to the channel in Kaun Banega Crorepati
In Quora, Vivek Rana, coordinator and assistant cinematographer with quite a few reality shows in his kitty, admitted that in KBC, you will only get to play the game if you accept to pay the channel 75% of your winning amount. If you're knocked out in the middle, you will get the winning amount only if your episode is broadcast, or else nothing.
Well, looks like even Big B's KBC is rigged on a lot of levels, which he may or may not be aware of.
7. Indian Idol contestants reportedly do not get to meet the celebrity judges in the first round.

Brief, nonchalant thread about my auditioning experience at Indian Idol 2012 and why I think it is a perfect platform to destroy your dreams as opposed to its common perception as a breeding ground for talent. â€” Nishant Kaushik (@nofreecopies) August 20, 2018
An entire Twitter thread by Nishant Kaushik in 2018 proves that during Indian Idol auditions, contestants are pushed to their limit - no water, no washroom, no leaving queue, standing for 24 hours. And by the end, when they get inside for the first audition, they realise there are no celebrity judges but normal crew members who randomly select people by making them sing a few lines. Clearly, that's not what they signed up for.
8. A contestant died right after Rakhi Ka Insaaf

Reality shows can sometimes take the most ugly turn. A 24-year-old man from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, who appeared on Rakhi Ka Insaaf, was so upset by the &quot;indecent remarks&quot; made against him by Rakhi Sawant, that he allegedly committed suicide.
9. The noise-makers in Bigg Boss are paid extra to make sure the TRPs keep soaring high
If sources are to be believed, the life of contestants inside the Bigg Boss, shown on the television isn't a true one. As per the rules of the show, contestants are not allowed to enjoy any luxury inside the house. But it seems like these rules are meant to be broken. According to sources, some participants on the show, who can't live without boozing are allowed to sip alcohol during the show. That's not all, the noise makers, if found doing well on the show, are paid extra to keep up their irrational behaviour.
There are also reports that celebrity contestants don't clean the toilets, kitchen or mop as shown on TV. They have staff on the weekend to clear up their mess, give them clothes and do their make up. Why am I not surprised?
10. Raja Chaudhry ended up assaulting Shraddha Sharma
B-grade actor Raja Chauhdary has been in and out of jail several times and this is only claim to fame. Yes, the actor, who was once married to Shweta Tiwari, entered Bigg Boss and rose to fame with his abusive language and misbehaviour. Soon, he started dating Shraddha Sharma and came on more reality shows like Love Lock Up. But, his nonsensical behaviour made him assault his girlfriend. Some claimed this was a relationship for mere TRPs and we totally think so.
11. Shilpa Shetty was constantly at the receiving end of sexist and racist remarks
Before Bigg Boss made its way to India, Shilpa Shetty went to UK to feature in Bigg Brother and faced substantial racism. Jade Goody picked on Shilpa and and used racial slurs against her. Little did Shilpa know, that the massive support she will get from across the globe, will make her the winner. But, the dark reality is that she had to struggle a lot inside the house and even promised she would never go back into the house.
12. Violent outburst are a thing now
KRK, Armaan Malik and Kushal Tandon ended up assaulting Bigg Boss contestants and they were given several warnings too. Well, it was evil but that's what lead to the show garnering insane amount of TRPs.
13. Priyanka Jagga and Swamiji ended up rocking the house like never before
Bigg Boss 10 had two controversial contestants like never before - Priyanka Jagga and Swami Om. He not only picked fights inside the house, but also threw pee on the contestants. The self-styled godman used misogynistic comments on every female participant. Rohan Mehra even ended up slapping him but his fanatic behaviour only stopped when Salman Khan told him to leave the house.
Same goes for Priyanka Jagga. She spoke ill about Manu Punjabi's mother, peed in her pants, used crass language and even screamed at Salman Khan. Well, needless to say, she was chucked out too.
There were reports, the duo was aware, and in fact, briefed by the makers of the show, to throw these tantrums and act silly.
14. Gauahar Khan was slapped while she was hosting a reality show
Gauahar Khan, who was seen in Bigg Boss and India's Raw Star got slapped during the finale of the latter, for wearing skimpy clothes. Not just that, the judge of the show, Honey Singh could not make it to the finale because of his professional commitments, and ended up getting hospitalized. He confessed to being bipolar and alcoholic. This show saw a lot of ups and downs.
Both suffered an indefinite period of trauma where Honey Singh became home-bound for almost 2 years, and Gauahar cried every time this horrific episode was mentioned. While some called it staged, film fraternity supported her.
Either ways, reality shows for contestants are tough to deal with. It can break you or make you.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
