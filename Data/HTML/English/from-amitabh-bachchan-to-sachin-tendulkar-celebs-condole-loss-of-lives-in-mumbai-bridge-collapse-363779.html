The incident took place at 7:20 pm when a big slab of the FOB came crashing down yesterday. Teams from NDRF, Mumbai Police, Fire Brigade and other rescue agencies reached the spot and immediately evacuated those buried under the rubble and shifted them to hospitals.
An FIR has been registered against officials concerned of the Central Railway and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) under section 304A (Causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code at the Azaad Maidan Police Station.
Soon after, the Maharashtra government announced ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each for the families of those who were killed in the tragic incident.
