Since the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s biopic has been announced, it is making headlines for some or the other reason. First, it was because of the trolls on social media after the poster starring Vivek Oberoi was released, and then when the trailer was out, it yet again became the butt of jokes.
Yesterday, Javed Akhtar slammed the filmmakers clarifying that despite the fact his name appears in the credits, he has not written any song for the movie.

Activist and lawyer Prashant Bhushan supported Javed Akhtar and called the credit &quot;defamatory&quot;.
It is defamatory to claim that the lyrics of a C grade election propaganda film are written by an outstanding poet & lyricist like Javed Akhtar. Shows the desperation of Bhakts https://t.co/CZxfoYfauQ — Prashant Bhushan (@pbhushan1) March 22, 2019
And today, lyricist Sameer also raised his voice to deny his association with the film as well. &ldquo;After reading his tweet, I called Javed saab to tell him that I too was not approached by the filmmaker or the production house to work on the biopic. I haven't written any song for the movie. I don't understand what they are crediting me for,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by Mid-day.

On the other hand, producer of the film Sandip Ssingh has clarified that the makers have used their old songs in the movie.
&ldquo;We have taken the songs 'Ishwar Allah' from the film '1947:Earth' and the song 'Suno Gaur Se Duniya Walon' from the film 'Dus' in our film, thus we have given the due credits to respective lyricists Javed Sahab and Sameer Ji. @TSeries is our Music partner,&rdquo; he wrote on Twitter.

Reacting to this, Sameer says, &ldquo;Even if the makers have used any of my old songs, the music label should be aware. But in this case, they too are clueless. On my part, I tried calling Omung Kumar and Sandeep Ssingh [producer], but their phones were switched off. What they have done is incorrect. They need to rectify it soon.&quot;

We have seen people not getting the credits for their work in the past. Kangana Ranaut and Apurva Asrani have had war of words in the public domain. But this is a strange case of false credits, isn’t it?</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
