Not Khans, But Beyonce Stole The Thunder With Her Sizzling Dance Moves At Isha Ambani's Bash
From Lakshi Mittal to Hilary Clinton and the entire B-Town, Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal's pre-wedding bash witnessed the presence of all big stars. It was a star-studded affair. Everyone danced and had a blast seemingly at the Sangeet ceremony!
But the highlight of the event was Beyonce. The Queen Bey flew to India for a special-personal concert at the Ambani bash.
She donned a desi avatar for the grand event! The two of her stunning attires were designed by Indian designers Abu Jani - Sandeep Khosla and Falguni and Shane Peacock.
She sang, she danced and she twerked and turned the event into one of the biggest musical nights!
