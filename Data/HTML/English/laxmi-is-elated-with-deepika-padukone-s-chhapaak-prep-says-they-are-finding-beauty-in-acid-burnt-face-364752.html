For Deepika Padukone, her upcoming movie Chhapaak is one such project.
In the film, that also marks her debut as a producer, Deepika Padukone will be seen playing an acid-attack survivor named Malti.
A few days ago, Padukone and the team of the film had shared the first look and it earned a lot of respect and praises from both her fans and people from her own fraternity.
Deepika is busy with the prep of the film and she has already started shooting for the project in Delhi. Today, she shared a picture and she captioned it as:
&ldquo;The only kinda homework I’ve ever enjoyed! #chhapaak.&rdquo;
Considering the kind of updates we have been getting about the film, it's very evident that it is an important project for the entire team. Recently, acid-attack survivor Laxmi, on whose life the film is loosely based on spoke about Deepika’s look in the film. Talking to IANS, she said,

&ldquo;I was happy to see Deepika’s first look from the film. The response and the messages I got on social media was overwhelming. In fact, it was my daughter’s birthday, and more than messages for her, I got congratulatory messages about the film. I was feeling good that a celebrity has come in that look. A lot of make-up artistes changed a natural face to acid distorted face after that (on social media). And I felt, ‘see, they are finding beauty in an acid-burnt face’.&rdquo;
She also made another important point. She added,
&ldquo;People are intrigued by Bollywood. A long time ago, a film named Tezaab came out. It spoke about beauty. Today, beauty through films is shown in a different manner and the youth will see and learn.&quot;
Helmed by Meghna Gulzar, the film also stars Vikrant Massey and will release on January 10, 2020.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
