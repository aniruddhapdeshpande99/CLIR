For the uninitiated, Soni Razdan had posted a picture of Junaid Khan, the boy who was stabbed to death on a train near Ballabhgarh in Haryana in June 2017.
&ldquo;I am Junaid Khan, Muslim boy, age 15. I was killed by a mob on a train for being a Muslim. Remember me when you vote,&rdquo; she wrote.

While some slammed her for spreading &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;, others countered her pointing out cases of Hindus being killed in violence across country. There were others who reminded her that Punjab and Haryana High court had said that the fight was over seat and not on the basis of religion.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
