&quot;We met for the first time while working on the film. She's from Delhi, I'm from Mumbai and she's way younger than me. She's part of our daily training sessions since she is on the direction team. So, she keeps us updated on any meetings we are supposed to attend. Whenever I'm in Kabir's [Khan, the director] office, she's there and is very involved in the process, be it planning the costumes or the schedule.&quot;
