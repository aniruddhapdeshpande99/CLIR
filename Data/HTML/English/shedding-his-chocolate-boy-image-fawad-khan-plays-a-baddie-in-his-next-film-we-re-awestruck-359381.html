Making his big screen return in Pakistan, the man who makes women go weak in their knees after 2007 film Khuda Ke Liye, is returning with The Legend of Maula Jatt.
The trailer of the movie was released a few days ago, and to see Fawad Khan in a totally different avatar, we are awestruck. He has apparently beefed up for the film, which is touted to be Pakistan’s most expensive movie so far.
