Uri has been the toughest role for Vicky Kaushal so far.

When asked to comment on Naseeruddin Shah’s controversial remarks that drew a lot of flak on social media, Vicky Kaushal said that he is not aware of what he said in detail but he believes that everyone should be heard and respected for their opinions.
&ldquo;I feel a human causing harm to another human is a very sad state. It is something we need to introspect, question. Lynching is something I would say is wrong. We are part of a democratic country but that doesn't mean we take law in our hands. Law has to step forward to see such incidents don't happen,&rdquo; he told PTI.
Meanwhile, Vicky Kaushal is gearing up for the release of Uri on Jan 11. Apart from Vicky, the movie also stars Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam and popular TV actor Mohit Raina in prominent roles.
