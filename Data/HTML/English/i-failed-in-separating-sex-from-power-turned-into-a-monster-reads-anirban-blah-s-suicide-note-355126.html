&quot;Without trying to justify any of my actions, I just want to say that I have tried to be the best person I can be. I didn't have the strength to cope with what happened to me as a child in a healthy way. I never was able to separate sex from power, to make it a part of love, and somewhere along the way, one part of me turned into a monster. Maybe ... I am bipolar.
Because I know how much love I have to give. To my friends and to my family to everyone. I have tried to be the best friend I can and the best colleague and the best person I can. But unfortunately the monster inside me keeps resurfacing and I've tried to bury him and kill him but I can't.
I wasn't good enough. And I am the only one to blame ... I know no one believes me, but that monster was a part of me, and there was goodness and kindness in me. To anyone I may have hurt, I am sorry. This isn't revenge for you. This is justice.
You should just know that the stories you hear are worse than the truth but whatever the truth, it still makes me a monster in my own eyes. Know though that this monster has this part of him that is pure still, and that my love for you is so great that I cannot forgive myself the hurt I have caused you. There are no justifications. You deserved better.
You will find my body somewhere near Vashi creek. My license will be with me as identification plus my tattoo. I am wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt. The monster inside me has won against the other part of me for too long, it's time to kill it once and for all.&quot;
According to reports, Blah is undergoing treatment at a trust-run hospital in Byculla.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
