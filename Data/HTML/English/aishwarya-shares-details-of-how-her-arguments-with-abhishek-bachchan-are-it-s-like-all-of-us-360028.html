When she was nudged a little to share details, she revealed,
&ldquo;We‚Äôre both genetically very generously been given very strong genes. So, we‚Äôre inherently very strong personalities. I think there is a very fine line between arguing and discussing and that‚Äôs something we‚Äôre still arriving at discovering what is what. So, we discuss a lot, either politely put it as discuss, probably argue but‚Ä¶&rdquo;
She was further asked if there is any habit of Abhishek Bachchan in particular that leads to a fight. She added,

&quot;It has been 12 years and how many years before that we‚Äôve known each other as friends. We‚Äôve known each other for quite a long time. We‚Äôve always conversed a lot and communicated a lot, in all its shades, in all the colours of the rainbow.''
