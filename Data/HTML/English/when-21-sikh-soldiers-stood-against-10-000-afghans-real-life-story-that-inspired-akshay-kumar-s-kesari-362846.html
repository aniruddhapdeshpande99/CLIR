Sardars are often called super-human entities. Have you ever seen a Sardar Ji begging? Never, right? That’s because the Khalsa says -- a Sikh must live on honest labour, give generously to the ones in need, because they believe whatever is given is given to the Guru. And when it comes to courage and valour, Sikh Regiment is one of the most decorated in the country.

But do you know the real-life story of the epic 1897 Battle of Saragarhi that has inspired the movie? Just reading the story might send shivers down your spines.
Akshay Kumar recently said that he feels sad that Indians don't know about the battle of Saragarhi.
&quot;It is sad that though the British celebrate Saragarhi Day, remembering the martyrs of the war, but we Indians do not know much about it. It is sad how an incident like this has got lost in the pages of history. It is hard to imagine how 21 Sikh soldiers stood strong inside a fort, knowing that 10,000 Afghan soldiers were waiting outside to kill them. Knowing that death is inevitable and continuing the fight requires a lot of bravery. That war was a pure example of that. They fought for our country, for our honour,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by IANS.

For starters, the battle is as legendary as the Battle of Thermopylae – the one which inspired the Zack Snyder’s movie 300. Akshay Kumar plays Havildar Ishar Singh, the leader of the regiment called 36th Sikhs, which was stationed in Saragarhi, a small village which is now in Pakistan. The area was frequently invaded by Afghans. On the day of battle, 10,000 men attacked the village. Since the British headquarters said that the army will take time to arrive, the Sikh men had to take the matter into their hands.

The battle of Saragarhi took place in the 19th century on 12th September 1897, which is called the Great Game. The name was given owing to the heightened tensions between Britain and Russia as they battled over territories in central Asia, including Afghanistan.

It was reported that 21 Sikh soldiers had killed 600 Afghans, as 600 bodies were found after the battle. The details of the Battle of Saragarhi are considered fairly accurate as Col. Haughton, who was constantly keeping in touch with Gurmukh Singh, had himself narrated it.

The soldiers were recognised by the British with memorials, a battle honour and a regimental holiday. All 21 soldiers were awarded the prestigious Indian Order of Merit Class III award.
