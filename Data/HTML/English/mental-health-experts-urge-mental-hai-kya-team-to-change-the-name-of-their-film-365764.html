Here are some reactions from Twitter and they are not positive.
People with real mental health issues are struggling to get treatment, because of the stigma with words like â€˜MENTALâ€™, â€˜PSYCHOâ€™. It is highly insensitive to have title like #MentalHaiKya I humbly request to change the title @RajkummarRao #KanganaRanaut â€” Dr. Pavan Sonar ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (@PavanSonar) April 17, 2019
>@SmritiSawhney Precisely the gripe I had even with the title #MentalHaiKya. The poster does not help the cause either. The layperson would not be able to differentiate between 'mentally ill' and 'Mental'. Those with #mentalillness are often called 'mental' in a derogatory way. https://t.co/SWhdqdNB0P â€” Vijay Nallawala (@VijayNallawala) April 17, 2019
The film also stars Amyra Dastur, Amrita Puri, Jimmy Shergill and it also has an extended cameo by Shah Rukh Khan.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
