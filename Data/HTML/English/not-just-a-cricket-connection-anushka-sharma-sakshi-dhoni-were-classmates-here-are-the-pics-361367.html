In an earlier interview, Anushka Sharma had talked about reuniting with Sakshi Dhoni years after graduating.
&ldquo;Sakshi and I lived together in a very small town in Assam. When she told me where she lived, I said wow, I have lived here too! She said I went to this school, I said I went to this school too. And then I found a picture in which Sakshi is dressed as a fairy and I’m dressed in a ghaghara like my favourite idol Madhuri. Sakshi is extremely funny.&rdquo;
