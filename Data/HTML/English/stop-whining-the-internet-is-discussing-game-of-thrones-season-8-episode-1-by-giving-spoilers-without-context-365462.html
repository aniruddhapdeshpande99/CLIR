Sunday night or in our case Monday morning brought with itself the most awaited treasure that all of us had been pining for! After an ultra long wait of 565 days, Game Of Thrones Season Finale has finally commenced. To say that it opened with a bang would be an understatement.
Now, we know the drill. Every episode of every season makes a large percentage of people whine and throw a fit. Why you ask? Well, the spoilers - what else!

Personally, i feel that it’s just balderdash. We can cut these whiners some slack for the previous seasons but the FINALE! I mean come on, it’s simple - you snooze, you lose! How can you wait desperately for something and not watch it the minute it premiers. So much for passion, right?
