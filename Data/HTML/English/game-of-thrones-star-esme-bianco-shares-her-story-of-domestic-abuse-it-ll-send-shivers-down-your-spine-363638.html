1/2 This photo was taken on my birthday many years ago. The night before I had been locked in the bedroom alone and had not slept. I was surviving on very little food and was physically and mentally exhausted - I often wasn’t allowed to sleep (cont) pic.twitter.com/0fdvJw9yXi — Esmé Bianco (@esmebianco) March 11, 2019
2/2 In this photo my boyfriend is giving me my birthday present. Despite the plastered on smile I can see the emptiness and fear in my eyes. We went for dinner later and he spent the whole evening berating me because he didn’t want to go out. I was not ok then and #IAmNotOk now — Esmé Bianco (@esmebianco) March 11, 2019
#iamnotOK because I still struggle with PTSD which has had a serious impact on my life and intimate relationships. — #EvanRachelWould (@evanrachelwood) March 11, 2019
I used to have to hide in a cupboard to call my family and friends #IAmNotOk — Esmé Bianco (@esmebianco) March 11, 2019
My abuser used masterful manipulation and gaslighting over many years so that I thought I was the one who was crazy, and that everything was my fault. That’s one of the hardest things to comes to terms with.
