Talking about the power couple, Gulshan (who was also a part of Ram-Leela) told Dainik Bhaskar, &ldquo;Deepika and Ranveer are getting married. Their romance started on the sets of Ram-Leela. We saw them getting close to each other there on the first day of shoot.&rdquo;
Gulshan added, &ldquo;I remember this schedule in Udaipur when I saw her sitting on his lap and I was like â€˜Hello when did this happen!â€™ So to see their romance coming a long way and then formalising it is a wonderful thing. So when you ask about Ram-Leela, their romance is the fondest memory I have right now because I saw it.&rdquo;
3. 2013 turned out to be a stupendous year for Deepika Padukone as she gave some top notching hits with Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Race 3, Chennai Express and of course Ram Leela.
Ranveer too had a good 2013 with Lootera and Ram Leela getting love from the audience and critics. The duo even featured in another movie which did not do well on the silver screen but got them closer. Yes, Finding Fanny where Ranveer has a cameo and out of all the roles from the movie, he played Deepika's husband in the film.
4. Ranveer had a dull response at the box office with Gunday and Kill Dil in 2014 but his love life was only soaring high.

8. The same year 2015, Deepika dealt with depression which had a long lasting impact on her. And guess who stand by her like a rock - Ranveer
Speaking to Barkha Dutt for a leading news channel, Deepika said, &quot;So it all started on the 15th of Feb last year, when I suddenly woke up one morning and had this pittish feeling.
Where you know, I had won all my awards and you know all the appreciation for 2013, everything had happened and it was a great time and obviously at once one gonna think like why is she depressed, she has everything going for her. But, I woke up one morning just feeling empty you know like this pittish feeling in my stomach that I was telling them that I get this pittish feeling in my stomach. I woke up like feeling directionless, I didn't know where to go, I didn't know what to do and I had these bouts of feeling so low that I would just start crying at the drop of the ha.
And the doting boyfriend Ranveer Singh is, he stood by like a rock. He stuck by Deepika and was extremely supportive and proud of her.
In the same year, Ranveer spoke about how moved he is by Deepika's gesture of discussing her depression problem with the media. &quot;I was in tears when I watched her talking about it (her depression) on a TV chat show. It takes a lot of mental and emotional fortitude to come out with something that has such a large (social) stigma attached to it. Deepika has won me over for life with the kind of strength and courage she has. Itâ€™s incredible.&quot;
