If reports are to be believed, Deepika Padukone has been approached by Chopard- a brand that's popular for its fine jewellery and watches. After Rihanna, who has been one of their faces for the brand, this surely is a big opportunity for Deepika Padukone.

While DP is yet to comment and confirm, we won't be surprised if the reports turn out to be true.
Agencies
If we talk about films, Deepika is busy with Chapaak, in which she won't be just starring in but she will also be producing the film.
