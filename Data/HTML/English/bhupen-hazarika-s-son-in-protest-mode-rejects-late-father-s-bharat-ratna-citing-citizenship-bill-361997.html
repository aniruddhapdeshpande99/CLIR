He slammed the government over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 -- a proposed law to grant citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants.
He also tagged the Bharat Ratna for his father &quot;a display of short lived cheap thrills&quot;.
In a media statement, Tez Hazarika, who is based in the US, expressed that he is extremely unhappy how the centre planned to pass the &quot;painfully unpopular&quot; Bill which was against his father's beliefs and position. His statement reads,
&quot;I believe that my father's name and words are being invoked and celebrated publicly while plans are afoot to pass a painfully unpopular bill regarding citizenship that is actually undermining his documented position. It would in reality be in direct opposition to what Bhupenda believed in his heart of hearts.&quot;
Just to jog your memory a little, Bhupen Hazarika was named for Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award, along with former President Pranab Mukherjee and Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader Nanaji Deshmukh. In his statement, Hazarika added,
&quot;I go on record here to answer that A) I have not received any invitation so far there is nothing to reject, and B)how the center moves on this matter far outweighs in importance the awarding and receiving of such national recognition - a display of short lived cheap thrills.&quot;
But the entire family is divided on the issue. Bhupen Hazarika's brother Samar Hazarika said in Assam he was &quot;not in touch&quot; with Tez. &quot;This award should be given to Bhupen. It's too late now,&quot; he said.
The maestro's sister-in-law Manisha Hazarika sort of agreed. A media statement quoted he saying,
&quot;Being a member of the Bhupen Hazarika family I am saying that this award is one of the most respected awards of this nation and Bhupen Da is a legendary figure. He is above politics, so raking up this controversy is wrong.&quot;
For the uninitiated, the citizenship Bill, is one of the key projects of the government and it proposes smoother and quicker grant of citizenship to non-Muslim illegal migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after six years' stay in India. But the topic has always been in the center of protests in the northeast.
