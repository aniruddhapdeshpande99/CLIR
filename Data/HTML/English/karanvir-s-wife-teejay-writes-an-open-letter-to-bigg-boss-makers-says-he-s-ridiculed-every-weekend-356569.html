However, not everyone is pleased with Karanvir's captaincy and how he won it during the bowl task inside the show. While Dipika was called an unfair sanchalak, some called it KV's game plan. But many outside the house have come out in support of Karanvir realising that during the Weekend Ka Vaar, the celebrity contestant is ridiculed by the host Salman Khan, not once but multiple times.

And it certainly hasn't gone down well with Karanvir's wife Teejay Sindhu. The TV actress and mother of two has written an open letter after watching the latest episode of Bigg Boss 12.

It is out of concern, and with the utmost respect that I write to you.. I needed to share with you how deeply hurt I am by the way #KaranvirBohra is being treated in BiggBoss... @ColorsTV @endemolshineind #BiggBoss12 #BB12 #KaranvirBohra #KVB #TeamKVB #KVBarmy pic.twitter.com/lpCSMRSZ2D â€” Teejay Sidhu (@bombaysunshine) November 12, 2018
She's not happy with the way KV is constantly made fun of, whether it's his choice of clothes, hair and looks. She has lashed out at the makers and and even apologized if KV has done something wrong to deserve this.

Taking an instance from this Weekend Ka Vaar, Teejay mentioned how Salman Khan taunted Karanvir saying there's no fizz left in him. Salman has apparently hurt not only Teejay but celebs from the TV fraternity as well.

Now TV celebs and Karanvir's fans have come together on social media in support of Teejay and KV. While some want Bigg Boss shut, some want Salman to be kinder to Karanvir. Take a look
