But it’s going to be worth the wait, says Damini Chopra, the actress who is making a debut with Sujeeth Reddy’s Saaho, in an exclusive chat with Indiatimes.
Forget Baahubali, Saaho will be as big as Mission Impossible.
&ldquo;Expect the movie to be as big as Mission Impossible or something of that sort. Baahubali is a very different genre, and it’s a different kind of classic. We are hoping to give the audiences something different, but it is definitely going to be as well-received and as well-enjoyed as Baahubali. Sujeeth Reddy is creating a great project and everyone must watch out for it.&rdquo;

Talking about Prabhas, Damini shares an interesting anecdote and reveals that in the first meeting itself she realised how down-to-earth he is.
&ldquo;The first day I went on sets, I walked up to him and I told him I am really nervous, it’s my first film and my very first shot with the Baahubali. To which he very sweetly told me, ‘You are nervous? You have gone to Harvard. I am nervous standing here.’ He broke the ice with that joke and from then on, everything became very easy from the word go.&rdquo;
For the uninitiated, Damini Chopra went to Harvard University in Boston for my undergraduate Degree in English Literature. Self admittedly, she has grown up watching Bollywood films and is a big fan of Shah Rukh Khan and Devdas is her favourite film.
Prabhas is down-to-earth and a lot of fun on sets!
&ldquo;You have this whole image of him being a superstar, who has a Baahubali image but in real life, he is lot of fun. In between the sets, we all used to play games like Suduko and just had a lot of fun in general.&quot;
&ldquo;He is a regular-guy next door off the screen, but the moment the camera turns on, his whole larger-than-life persona comes on-screen and you are just left stunned. Also, he is very punctual and helpful on sets.&rdquo;
On being asked about one thing that fans shall be looking forward to about Saaho, Damini Chopra says &ldquo;Prabhas. And how good he is going to look.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Everyone is going to surprise you with different looks in this film,&rdquo; she adds.
Furthermore, talking about her experience working with Shraddha Kapoor, Damini said that she was impressed by how dedicated and focussed she is on the sets.
Also starring Neil Nitin Mukesh and Mandira Bedi and produced on a budget of Rs 300 crore reportedly, Saaho will hit the screens on Aug 15.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
