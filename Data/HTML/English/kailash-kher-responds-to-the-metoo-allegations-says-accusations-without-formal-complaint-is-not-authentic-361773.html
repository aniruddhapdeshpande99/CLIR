Soon after, four other women raised allegations against the Teri Deewani singer. Now responding to this, Kailash Kher said,
Reacting to this, Kailash Kher said: &quot;Everyone has their own thinking. If I accuse someone only by taking that individual's name over and over again then, nothing will come out of it. If you will take legal recourse against that person, then it becomes another matter altogether.&quot;

&quot;If I tell you that I will not make a complaint against that individual, but still I will accuse him of doing certain criminal activity, then I feel it's not an authentic complaint,&quot; he added.
Kailash Kher will be seen doing a live concert of Kailasa all over India and the world. Along with that, he's also working on a new album Tham Ja.
