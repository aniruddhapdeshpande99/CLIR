Game of Thrones season 8 is finally happening ‚Äì it has officially begun. After 595 days, if anything says it‚Äôs worth it, then it was the epic battle of Winterfell. The Long Night finally came and the Night King and his army of dead are no more. There are three more episodes left but one more epic battle that will decide who finally sits on the Iron throne.
But wait‚Ä¶ did you notice that this season has been more dramatic than ever before? These instances prove just that. Take a look!
#1 To be honest, Drogon staring at Jon Snow as he kissed Daenerys Targaryen has to be the funniest scene on GoT!

#2 Cersie refused Euron Greyjoy‚Äôs indecent proposal only to agree after 30-seconds. All for a savage, epic one-liner? #JustCerseiThings
Twitter
Of course, this scene was as dramatic as any 90‚Äôs SRK film.

#3 Arya appeared from nowhere to kill the Night King.

In the episode‚Äôs climatic moment, Arya Stark pounces on him from nowhere and then stabs him, like it was child‚Äôs play.
#4 And then her mid-air hand-switch was just too much!
via GIPHY
To kill the Night King, Arya Stark pulls off a Michael Jordan-esque midair hand switch. Like seriously?

#5 Night King's smirk at Daenerys!
Hotstar
Night King's smirked at Daenerys after she realises that dragon fire did nothing. That was the final hint of a human emotion from the deadliest creature. For some, it was terrifying, and for others, it was funny.
#6 Love was in the air during the war!
via GIPHY
The battle of life and death is going on, and strangely everyone is with their crushes. Tyrion and Sansa are discussing they could have made a better couple. Arya saves the Hound from White Walkers and then he saves her life later. Jorah Mormont and Danny are fighting the battle together. In fact, Jaime, Tormund and Ser Brienne of Tarth (the love-triangle) are also battling it out together.
You know, who was the only lonely person? Jon Snow. He didn‚Äôt even get to kill the Night King. That wasn‚Äôt fair, tbh.
#7 It was such a big battle but no major character died. NONE.
Twitter
While fans were speculating that Arya, Jaime or Brienne Of Tarth might be dead in the biggest ever battle against the army of dead in Game of Thrones, none of the major characters died. All of them got lucky multiple times.
#8 Everybody got drunk before the war because #JoHaiSamaKalHoNaHo!
via GIPHY
Tormund and Jaime were close to confessing their love for Brienne of Tarth under the influence of alcohol. Also, Brienne became the first woman Knight of the seven kingdoms because Jaime was drunk and all emotional.
#9 No wait, some were enjoying sex as well.
via GIPHY
Why did Arya had to sleep with Gendry. Why?
#10 And what‚Äôs up with Bran? And why the hell he had to warg during the battle?
Twitter
And the big question is where did he go? why nobody asks him any questions?
#11 That piano background score during the last 20 minutes of the battle made it even more dramatic.
But honestly, it was amazing. Kudos to Ramin Djawadi, the man behind it.
