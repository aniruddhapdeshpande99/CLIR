&quot;Irrfan and his family are planning to celebrate Diwali at their Nashik farmhouse. It will be a 10-day trip after which he will return to the UK for his ongoing treatment. He is yet to be given a clean chit by his doctors on whether he can start full-fledged work. The doctors are hopeful that he can return to the set by March. But he will have to follow the guidelines that his oncologists give him. The biopic will have to be divided into shorter schedules.&quot;
Apart from Hindi Medium, Irrfan's upcoming projects also include Shoojit Sircar's Uddhan Singh biopic and Vishal Bhardwaj's Sapna Didi.
