Salman Khan's Race 3 got worst reviews ever, Aamir Khan's Thugs Of Hindostan flopped, and Shah Rukh Khan’s Zero also failed miserably at the box office. So much so, that it’s struggling to even touch the Rs 100 crore mark!

Even big budget films need good scripts, thinks Tigmanshu Dhulia, who played Shah Rukh Khan’s father in the movie, which also starred Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma in prominent roles.

On the other hand, Vidhu Vinod Chopra thinks that it’s time for stars to realise that scripts come first.
&ldquo;I think all the so called stars must realise that the script comes first. During 'Dangal', Aamir Khan had hosted a party and I was there. Someone asked me about Aamir and his top position in the industry. I was like, if the film would have had Hrithik Roshan in it, it would have worked anyway. But if it was a bad film, it wouldn't have worked.' Then Aamir called me and said, you are taking a dig on me at my own party.' Now ask him what has happened? Whatever I had said back then was true or false?,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying by IANS.

If Zero fails, I won’t get work for 6-10 months – that’s what Shah Rukh Khan had said before the release of the movie.
