&ldquo;My mother just said that Kartik isn’t interested in marrying right now. He is very much focussed on his career and on top of that, I don’t know who you are. But that man wouldn’t take no for an answer. He said agar abhi nahi kar raha hai, toh bhi chalega, chaar saal baad bhi ho chahe, aap abhi se block kar lo, as if koi advance booking ho.&rdquo;
