Accepting The Crazy Hype Around Grandson Taimur, Sharmila Tagore Says 'We Have To Live With It'
For the first time ever, Taimur's paternal grandmother and veteran actress Sharmila Tagore has reacted to the crazy hype that paps have created around him. She said that the only way she and her family could have dealt with media’s obsession with grandson Taimur Ali Khan was by accepting it.
The two-year-old son of Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor is always surrounded by a bunch of paparazzi and his photos regularly go viral.
On Sunday, interacting with the media at the HELLO! Hall of Fame Awards 2019, the 74-year-old former silver screen queen said,

&ldquo;I suppose we have to live with it. This is the age of social media. I don’t think anything can be done about it.&rdquo;
She has figured an apt way of dealing with it all. She feels if one cannot beat the trend then one should join it. However, she is also apprehensive. She feels the excessive media coverage is not good for Taimur as he is too small to deal with it.
&ldquo;I am very old-fashioned. I don’t think children should be exposed to all this. However I learnt from Sara (Sara Ali Khan, Taimur’s half-sister) to say if you can’t beat them, then join them,&rdquo; she told the media.
Taimur’s pictures regularly feature on Page 3. He catches more eyeballs apparently than any actor’s kid of the film industry. When asked what Sharmila felt about that, she said
&ldquo;I guess I should be happy about it but I don’t think it’s very good for the child.&rdquo;

Recently, Kareena had spoken to PTI and she also reacted to the whole Taimur craze. A report quoted her as saying,
&quot;We view it as something socially irresponsible because we have been such good parents, we haven't shied away, we never hid Taimur's face. In Hollywood, they don't allow children's faces to come (publish). But because Saif and I took the modern approach, we can't do that. He would think 'what is happening?' I don't want him to grow up in that fear. I want him to grow up and fly, that's what parents want their children to do. I can't keep him away.&quot;

On the other hand, Daddy Saif had a rather calm take on it. When he was asked if the attention around Taimur worries him, he said,
&quot;I can only hope he’ll take it as it comes and develop a certain humility. Like Taimur, I too am lucky to be born a Pataudi, go to Winchester College, get work in the industry when there were others who were brighter and more talented. It was a privilege whose worth I didn’t understand then. Hopefully, my son will be more conscious and conscientious. There’s something special about him. During the day, he’s waddling around the house, but in the evening, when I dim the lights, light the candles, put on some music, he’s happy to sit quietly with Kareena and me, drinking his milk, soaking in the ambience. As a parent I can only nurture him.&quot;
