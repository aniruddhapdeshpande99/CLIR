On Easter Sunday, she was granted a one-day leave to celebrate with her family, reported People magazine.
Spears, 37, opened up to fans in January on Instagram about her dad’s health, saying she was taking an indefinite hiatus ahead of her planned Domination residency in Las Vegas, which was set to kick off in February, because her father had &ldquo;almost died&rdquo;.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
