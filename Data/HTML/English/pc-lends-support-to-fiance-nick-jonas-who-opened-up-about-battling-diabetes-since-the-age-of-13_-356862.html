&ldquo;You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.&quot;
This saying fits in perfectly in Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' love story. American singer and Priyanka Chopra's soon-to-be-husband Nick Jonas recently revealed that he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at a very young age.
In his post, Nick didn't just mention his lifelong struggle with diabetes but also explained why one should never let anything hold you back from living your best life.

Nick shared his 'then and now' pictures and explained how he has a full control over his life now on day-to-day activities.
In his post, he wrote,
&quot;13 years ago today I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The picture on the left is me a few weeks after my diagnosis. Barely 100 pounds after having lost so much weight from my blood sugar being so high before going to the doctor where I would find out I was diabetic. On the right is me now. Happy and healthy. Prioritizing my physical health, working out and eating healthy and keeping my blood sugar in check.&quot;

He also thanked his family and fans for the good wishes. He added,
&quot;I have full control of my day to day life with this disease, and I'm so grateful to my family and loved ones who have helped me every step of the way. Never let anything hold you back from living your best life. Thank you to all my fans for your kind words and support. Means more than you know. Love you all. #grateful#diabetes #livebeyond#fbf.&quot;
What was sweeter than the message he posted was how PC wrote the most beautiful thing on the post. She wrote,
The 26-year-old recently celebrated his super fun bachelor weekend with his gang of boys, including brothers Joe Jonas, Kevin Jonas and Franklin Jonas, brother-in-law Siddharth Chopra and close friend Jonathan M Tucker.
After dating for five months, Nick popped the question and PC couldn't say no. The couple got engaged in Mumbai in August and reports claim that the two are looking forward to tying the knot in Jodhpur in December. The couple also obtained a marriage license in the United States recently.
