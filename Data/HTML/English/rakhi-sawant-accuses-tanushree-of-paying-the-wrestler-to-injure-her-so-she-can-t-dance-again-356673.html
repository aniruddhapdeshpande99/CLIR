Wondering what has she done now? To give you a bit of context, she was at a Continental Wrestling Entertainment (CWE) match in Panchkula, Haryana. She was supposed to perform there but she waged a war.
She challenged a wrestler and got knocked out so bad that she landed in a hospital soon after. It is said that she suffered a lumbar injury in the tailbone area. But has that put a stop to the motor mouth that she is? Of course, NOT!
After having posted the videos from the fight, and then lying on a bed in pain, she has now accused Tanushree Dutta of paying the wrestler in order to injure her, so that she could never dance ever again.
Yes, she stated that in the post that you can read below.
