More often than not, Sikhs are a butt of joke. The characters are portrayed as dumb. Sardar jokes find their way into Bollywood movies as well. The characters are made funny and are almost always dancing. But if you have met Sardars in real life, you would know that Bollywood has only stereotyped them in the cinematic world.

Making some really valid points, Comedian Jaspreet Singh has slammed Bollywood for stereotyping the image of Sikhs in Bollywood. From older films to the latest one up for release, Akshay Kumar starrer Kesari, he takes a dig a Bollywood for not showing a true picture. Not only has he criticised the look of the Sikh characters, including that of Akshar Kumar in Kesari, he has also slammed script writing for reusing the old Santa Banta jokes.
According to Jaspreet Singh, the only films that have Sardar characters portrayed in the right manner are Border, Ghazi Attack, Oye Lucky Lucky Oye. What’s your take on this? Tell us in the comments section below.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
