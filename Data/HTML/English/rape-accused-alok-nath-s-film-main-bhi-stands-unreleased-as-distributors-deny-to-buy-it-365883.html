One of them was the ‘most sanskaari’ actor of Bollywood Alok Nath, who was accused of rape. His inclusion in Ajaj Devgn starrer De De Pyaar De is already facing a backlash. From Tanushree Dutta to Vinta Nanda, everyone has openly dissed and lashed out at the makers for not replacing him after sexual harassment allegations were made on him.
Amid all of this, Alok Nath’s next film Main Bhi is facing a tough time. The movie stands unreleased as many distributors have rejected the film after knowing Alok Nath’s association with it.

The irony is that Alok Nath is playing the role of a judge who takes a strong stance on sexual harassment in the movie. The man who is himself fighting the legal battle after #MeToo accusation will play a judge in the forthcoming movie. Well, that’s quite ironical.
&ldquo;We wrapped up our film last year in July, long before the allegations against Alok Nath ji were made public and he was banned. A year ago, any producer would have cast him in such a role,&rdquo; producer Imran Khan was quoted as saying in an India Today report.
Alok Nath was accused of rape by Vinta Nanda who worked with him on the TV show Tara. According to her, the incident took place 20 years ago when the show was running on TV. Post her accusation, Himani Shivpuri and Sandhya Mridul had also accused Alok Nath of sexual misconduct, but he denied the claims.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
