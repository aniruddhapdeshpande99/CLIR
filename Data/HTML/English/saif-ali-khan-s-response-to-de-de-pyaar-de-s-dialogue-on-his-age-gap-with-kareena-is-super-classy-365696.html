Married for the second time to Kareena Kapoor, Saif is seen as a devoted husband and a doting father. He can be seen balancing his personal and professional life.
People in the past dissed him for divorcing Amrita Singh and having a colourful life, some even spoke about their huge age gap when they were getting married. For the uninitiated, Amrita and Saif had an age gap of about 12 years where Amrita was older.

But after he got married to Kareena, the age gap became 12 years with Saif being the older one. And so the makers of an upcoming film De De Pyaar De decided to make a little dialogue on the celebrity age gap which could have been a little offensive to Saifeena.
In the trailer of Ajay Devgn starrer, Ajay's character lists down famous couples with huge age differences like Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Amal Clooney and also Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor in his attempt to tell: &quot;Main duniya ka pehla aadmi nahi hoon jo apne se chhoti ladki ko date karne ki soch raha hai.&quot; Take a look.
While people thought it may evoke outrage and the couple might tell them to delete but looks like Ajay called up Saif to clear the air. As per reports, the minute the trailer released, Ajay spoke about the trailer and Saif had the coolest reaction to it, &quot;Hey, that's cool, man.&quot;
The movie, De De Pyaar De, is about a middle-age divorcee who falls in love with a woman 20 years his junior. Starring Tabu, Ajay Devgn, Rakulpreet, the movie is slated to release on 17th May, 2019.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
