Fans Shower Love On Robert Downey Jr On His 54th Birthday, Call Him The Godfather Of Marvel
Did you know that Tom Cruise was almost close to being cast as Tony Stark AKA Iron Man – the character with which it all began? It has been 11 years since Iron Man was released, and in all these years, Marvel Cinematic Universe has grown so rapidly that it is now the biggest franchise of all time. And it’s all because of Iron Man AKA Robert Downey, Jr.
via GIPHY
Can you even imagine any other actor in that role? When the makers of the film were a little skeptical to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the role because of his controversial past, director Jon Favreau unremittingly campaigned for him. And then, as they say, a star was born.
via GIPHY
Not many people know that when he was six, his father fed him marijuana and he pretty much spent his major chunk of life in rehabs thereafter. He is sober since 2003. And his charisma and personality are making people swoon since then.
He is witty, sarcastic and humorous. Robert Downey, Jr. is just not a celebrity but a phenomenon. He is hailed as the ultimate Avengers by his fans.
When the rumours were rife that he is quitting Marvel after Avengers: Endgame, fans were disheartened. Isn’t it impossible to picture MCU without him?
