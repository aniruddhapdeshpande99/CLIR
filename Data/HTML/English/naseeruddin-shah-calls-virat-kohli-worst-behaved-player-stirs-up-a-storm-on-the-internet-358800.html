Naseeruddin Shah- &quot;Virat Kohli is the worst behaved cricketer in the world&quot;
But what about him when he allegedly stepped into the game (invisible to everyone), sabotages the opponent team and helped Sunder's team to succeed massively, That was nothing but cheating tbh. #ausvind â€” Monica (@monicas004) December 17, 2018
Virat Kohli worldâ€™s worst behaved player: Naseeruddin Shah
Someone please show these pictures to Mr. Shah. pic.twitter.com/Kp94tGyCwu â€” Madhav Sharma (@HashTagCricket) December 17, 2018
How utterly vile and unjust of Naseeruddin Shah to comment on Virat Kohli's imagined arrogance. The guy is just passionate about cricket and wears his heart on his sleeve. He has not hurt anyone or is more unsporting than his peers. This just shows Naseer's lack of class. â€” Nitin Sharma (@nitin1sharma) December 17, 2018
