The movie is finally seeing the light of the day and in a statement, Kumar said, &quot;It is a film made for young people all over India to connect with young people all over Kashmir, about the euphoria and hopefulness of being young - an A certificate would keep both these audiences away from each other. Now I am confident that kids will come out with their hearts beating for Kashmir.&quot;
The film is everything we should know about Kashmir-that we don't!

The film is a story of a British-Kashmiri girl Noor (Zara La Peta Webb) who visits Kashmir to look for her father, who had disappeared years ago. She gets help from a local teenager, Majid (Shivam Raina), who takes her to a forbidden zone near the Indo-Pak border. However, they get caught and arrested.

While Noor gets freedom because she is British, the tale then takes us through the journey of a struggle for Majid's freedom.
