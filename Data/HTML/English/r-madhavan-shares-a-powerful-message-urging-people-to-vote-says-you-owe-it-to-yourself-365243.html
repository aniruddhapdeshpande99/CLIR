First phase ! Go vote people! â€” TheRichaChadha (@RichaChadha) April 11, 2019
Voting is a constitutional right that we are privileged to have. Letâ€™s not take it for granted. Our Constitution has given us this right to elect who we want running our great country . Go cast your vote.
Good luck India.
