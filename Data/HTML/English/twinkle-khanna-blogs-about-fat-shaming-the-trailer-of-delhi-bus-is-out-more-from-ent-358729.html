From Fat-Shaming To Women’s Weight Stigma, Twinkle Khanna Blogs About ‘Weighty Matters’
The question still remains why women are body shamed, especially in a field like politics where physical form has absolutely no role to play. I remember a laughing Renuka Chowdhury once making a self-deprecatory joke about her weight (By the way, most chubby girls, including me, joke about our weight as part of our defence mechanism). But Venkaiah Naidu told her, ‘My simple suggestion is, reduce your weight and make efforts to increase the weight of the party’. Then during a cabinet shuffle, Smriti Irani was shifted to the textile ministry. While none of the other ministers, all men to be noted, were lampooned, the size of her blouse became a butt of jokes on Twitter.
The spine-chilling Nirbhaya rape case had jolted the entire nation's conscience in 2012, after the details of the horrific rape case, in which a woman was gang-raped inside a moving bus. The grave details that included an iron rod being inserted in her private parts which led to her demise later, after she was taken to Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital by the government for her treatment, still gives goosebumps to all of us.
