Reports also claim that Kapil Dev himself will be training Ranveer. A bollywoodlife report has quoted a source as saying,
&ldquo;Ranveer’s cricket coaching will be with Balwinder Singh Sandhu - also a key member of the 1983 World Cup winning squad. While Sandhu and Ranveer will work rigorously to perfect the game, Ranveer will also train with the legend Kapil Dev! Kapil will coach him to perfect his iconic bowling action and Ranveer will work with him to pick up all his mannerisms on and off the field! We can’t wait to see them together hitting the nets!&rdquo;
A few weeks ago, Singh had spoken about 83. He had said,
&ldquo;It is an important part of our sports history and history as a nation, our first world cup win and it had put us on top of the world, stamped our presence on the map.&rdquo; India defeated West Indies, victors of the first two world cups, in the tournament by 43 runs to clinch the trophy.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
