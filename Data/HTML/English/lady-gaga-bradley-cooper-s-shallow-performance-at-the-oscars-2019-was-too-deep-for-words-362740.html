&ldquo;This is hard work. I’ve worked hard for a long time. It’s not about winning -- what it’s about is not giving up. If you have a dream, fight for it. There’s a discipline for passion, and it’s not about how many times you get rejected or you fall down or get beaten up. It’s about how many times you stand up and are brave and keep going.&rdquo;
&quot;Only because you can't really thank yourself. Lady Gaga, we salute you.&quot;
