A lot of people came out and shared their decades-old stories of being harassed and molested. Joining the bandwagon is actor Parvathy, who says it took her years to realize that she was assaulted as a child and that it’s still a daily affair for her to consider herself a survivor.
&ldquo;It happened to me when I was very young. It took me 17 years to realise it did happen to me. I was three or four years old. I didn’t ask for it. But I was assaulted. And then to speak about it, it took me another 12 years,&rdquo; Parvathy said at the Jio MAMI 20th Mumbai Film Festival with Star on Tuesday.
She added, &ldquo;To sit and speak of it as a fact that has happened to me…but not being defined by my gender. So, I sit here as a person first and then rest of the tags come in. But you know where the survival part comes… it’s still a struggle for me on a daily basis to realise it, acknowledge it and get past it. It’s a daily affair. And then let my friends know, my parents, cope with it. It becomes an extreme exercise on a daily basis.&rdquo;
She further added how she was brought up as a pretty confident and outspoken girl. Still, she wondered did she ask for it or did she deserve it.
