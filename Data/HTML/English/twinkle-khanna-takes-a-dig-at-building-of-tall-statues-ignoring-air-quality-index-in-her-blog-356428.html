Send the driver to fetch your uncle from the station.’
‘Nani, my driver is on leave today and I can’t go either! There is a nasty ant infestation at home that I am trying to get rid of.’ She replies, ‘You should not kill ants, they are very lucky.’
‘Yes Nani,’ I mutter, ‘Ants are lucky, it’s just people like me covered in bites who are unlucky.’

My protests are pushed aside, and as usual Nani manages to get me to do her bidding.
3 pm Once Biren Bhai and his dabba of precious fafdas are safely ensconced in the car, he begins rattling away in great excitement. ‘When are you coming to Gujarat? You have to come to see the Statue of Unity, not very expensive, only Rs 350.’

I reply, ‘I thought it was 3,000 crore, no?’
‘Dikri, that is for the full and final statue, this I am telling you is ticket price for observation deck view.’
I reply, ‘Have you heard about the controversy over the statue? There was an article in the Daily Mail filled with British outrage about the UK giving 1.17 billion pounds as aid to India and us spending around a third of that on erecting statues.’
My uncle gets annoyed, ‘Amtha, amtha sawal nai puch. British people are all salo chors! They took billions from us and tucked it nicely in their khisu, now what they are giving is interest on our capital only.’
Finally though, the four-and-a-half hours on Paschim Express take their toll and he nods off.
5 pm Pulling out weeds in my garden, I look out at the tranquil Arabian Sea. If things go according to plan, soon enough I will be able to spot a 212m Shivaji statue rising from the waves.
I recall reading a story about a philosophy professor who filled an empty jar with rocks, and then asked his students if the jar was full. When the students nodded, he dropped pebbles inside which rolled in between the rocks.
The professor then poured sand and filled up the remaining areas of the jar. Using it as an analogy for well-being, he said, ‘This jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things — your family and your health. The pebbles are other things that matter like your job, your house. The sand is everything else, all the small stuff. If you put the sand into the jar first then there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks.’
But I wonder if we as a nation are focusing more on building sand castles in our jars. The Global Hunger Index 2018 ranks India at a poor 103 out of 119 countries, with one out of every five children under the age of five suffering from acute under-nutrition.
The World Health Organisation reports that 14 of the world’s most polluted cities are in our country, with Kanpur topping the list. Our focus though seems to be on renaming cities and building towering statues. But I suppose, if playing statue-statue is the name of the game then we may as well spend another few hundred crore to ensure that the world’s tallest statues are made a tad more relevant by having the world’s biggest anti-pollution masks sitting jauntily on their noses.
8 pm Not only do I have ants running around my house looking for edible items but I also have relatives who are doing the same. My mother arrives with Nani and Biren Bhai, while my mother-in-law has invited all her five brothers.

While Mother is nagging me about how the hot snacks are apparently not hot enough, Biren Bhai has been discussing his new business venture with the mamas. On hearing snatches of their conversation, I am almost tempted to ask my uncle if the tallest statue in the world has inspired him to invest in a product called Dr Ayurveda Height Increaser. Vinay mama turns to my mother-in-law and reels off product details from Biren Bhai’s phone: &ldquo;This product increases height in humans. It has no side-effects and is approved by Medical Council of India.&rdquo; He then adds with a laugh, &ldquo;Arre Biren Bhai, this is a foolish business idea! How can this work on adults? At our age the only direction we can grow in is sideways.’
Over the years, I have noticed that politics has affected our family on a deeply personal level. When Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, my in-laws dancing to the tune of Singh is King would bully my meeker Gujarati relatives, but after Modiji has taken over, the Gujjus are ready with snappy comebacks.
A belligerent Biren Bhai retorts, ‘What do you know about business? Let me tell you all great businessmen in India — Ambani, Adani, Kotak — are all Gujarati! You people may have muscle power but we have brain power. My bapuji always used to say, &ldquo;In business, Sindhis sell and Punjabis buy, but the middle person who makes a profit is none other than a Gujarati.&rdquo;’
Unfortunately since Biren Bhai has not begun consuming the Height Increaser pills, he is still considerably tinier than Vinay mama. And before mamaji turns him from a spongy khaman into a deflated thepla, the man of the house quickly leads him away.
I look at my nani and sigh, ‘Don’t feel bad Nani, but really Biren Bhai is the reason why I think ants are better than uncles.’
My poor pun literally falls on deaf ears as Nani has left her hearing aid at home, so off I go to grab, if not the tallest, but definitely the largest drink I can get.
Sometimes you do need to pour some Scotch on the rocks to fill your jar of well-being right up to the brim.
