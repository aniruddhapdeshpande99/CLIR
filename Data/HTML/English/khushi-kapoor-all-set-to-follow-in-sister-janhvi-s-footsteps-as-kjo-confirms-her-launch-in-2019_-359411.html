Neha quizzed KJo which star kids he will be launching in 2019 and he replied,
&ldquo;Mizaan is going to be amazing; he is a potential big star and a great dancer. And Khushi perhaps, she is gorgeous and lovely.&rdquo;

Mizaan is Javed Jaffery’s son while Khushi is already popular thanks to the Kapoor surname. This year, we saw Khushi’s elder sister Janhvi making her debut with Dhadak, which was appreciated by fans. And now, we are sure Janhvi will guide her sister throughout her mega acting debut.
