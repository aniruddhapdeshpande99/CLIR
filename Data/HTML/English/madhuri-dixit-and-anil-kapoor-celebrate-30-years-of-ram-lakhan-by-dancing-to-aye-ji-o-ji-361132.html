Their song, Dhak Dhak Karne Laga , from Beta is still one of the most popular dance numbers from the 90s. And now after almost a decade, the two are coming together for Indra Kumar's Total Dhamaal.
''I am paired opposite Anil Kapoorji and there is a brilliant star cast, including Ajay Devgn, Javed Jaffrey, Arshad Warsi, and the story was so wonderful when I heard the script,&quot; Madhuri said during a press conference.
During the promotions of the film, Anil and Madhuri realized it's been 30 years to Ram Lakhan and they decided to celebrate it in their own unique way. Take a look.
