&ldquo;It’s a great honour to receive this award. I also feel gratified in a way to know that my films not only entertain audiences in India but globally,&rdquo; Rajkummar said in a statement. &ldquo;I’ve had very distinguished films in 2018 and this win certifies that the audiences are also open to experimentation and watching something new and interesting,&rdquo; he added. At the function in Oman, Rajkummar also performed to his hit song Kamariya from Stree with Nora Fatehi.
Tweeting about his win and sharing a picture, he wrote: &ldquo;Won the #FilmfareMiddleEast performer of the year award in Oman last night for my work in #Stree and #Omerta. GRATITUDE.&rdquo;
A couple of days back he had tweeted about Kangana Ranaut and their upcoming film Mental Hai Kya. He had written: &ldquo;Just watched #Manikarnika. An amazing film that chronicles the life of the queen of Jhansi. Kangana,as always, was phenomenol as Rani Laxmi bai. Now can’t wait for you guys to watch #MentalHaiKya.&rdquo; He was obviously impressed with her work in Manikarnika.
