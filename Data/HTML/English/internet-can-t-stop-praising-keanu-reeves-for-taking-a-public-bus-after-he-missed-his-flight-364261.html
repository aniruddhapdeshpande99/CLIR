Internet Can't Stop Praising Keanu Reeves For Taking A Public Bus After He Missed His Flight
&ldquo;Three things in human life are important: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; and the third is to be kind.&rdquo;
Well, kindness is the most cherished trait that a person can ever have and one celebrity who can easily be named as the president of world's kindness club is Keanu Reeves. His onscreen roles might be rugged and hard-hitting but in real life, his heart is of gold!
People have time and again spotted him taking public transport and he has also been actively involved in charities round the world! And now, internet is again hailing and for a very special reason.
After missing his flight, Keanu was seen waiting and interacting at the airport. He later took a bus ride with them. Someone who was present shot a video of the entire experience. And people are absolutely bowled away by his niceness.
