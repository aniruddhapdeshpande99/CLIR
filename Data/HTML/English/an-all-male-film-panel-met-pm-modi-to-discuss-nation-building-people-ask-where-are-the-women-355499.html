Well, the outrage over this picture built up when people spotted that this panel didn't include even one single woman from the film industry.
&quot;Where is Rima Das? Her movie is going for Oscars and she has not been included? wrote one user.
Other users pointed out how this panel can discuss nation building and development without a single woman in sight.

Today, when we talk about women empowerment and feminism, it is shocking and sad to see that no woman could make the cut in the list of members of the panel. This picture triggered a lot of anger and angst among people who couldn't stop but asking, &quot;Where are the women?&quot;.
In case you are wondering what made the netizens angry today, these tweets sum up the reason well.

1. Where are women? 2. Why only Hindi belt? https://t.co/8RxxLJkDRA â€” Amanuensis (@amansrvstv1) October 26, 2018
WHERE ARE THE WOMEN https://t.co/0mdRHYDTkA â€” Srishti Dixit (@srishtidixit) October 26, 2018
....By including more women in delegations and making Bollywood a safer place for women https://t.co/0HdhAjWBa9 â€” Faye DSouza (@fayedsouza) October 26, 2018
They couldn't find a single woman to be part of that delegation, to discuss the entertainment industry's contribution to nation building. Women aren't part of nations, or the entertainment industry. (Or maybe even some buildings.) Patriarchy upholds everything ðŸ¤· https://t.co/qt4wDEAvFh â€” Vijayeta (@SacredInsanity) October 26, 2018
Serious? Not a single woman in the delegation? https://t.co/YY3uBSZSSx â€” Nigel Britto (@NigelBritto) October 26, 2018
Hey Hon. PM, where are the brave women from #Bollywood who spoke up? Need to build the nation? Involve women! #MeTooIndia https://t.co/Ws3cWo0PSW â€” Hanisha Lalwani (@HanishaLalwani) October 26, 2018
What?! No women in this gathering? Entertainment industry has women as an intrinsic part of it. How do they dream of nation building without involving women in the process? Disappointing. https://t.co/bXRQjNm9ET â€” N (@_morphiine_) October 26, 2018
So many women, wow. We're truly moving towards a equal society. We totally don't need feminism. Pfft. https://t.co/XJCVA1GNRg â€” Sulagna Chatterjee (@BeingChatterjee) October 26, 2018
And ya'll didn't think it was important to have some women be a part of this? https://t.co/fMkfMAjxcQ â€” Junisha Dama (@bandeatqueen) October 26, 2018
NO woman in the delegation!! These producers possibly think they can make the film and build the nation without womenâ€™s participation. https://t.co/jbJJWG1aHP â€” Kanchan Srivastava (@Ms_Aflatoon) October 26, 2018
Women may hold up half the sky, but they can't touch the proverbial glass ceiling. https://t.co/k5pmwo3hhE â€” Kiran Manral (@KiranManral) October 26, 2018
The Indian entertainment industry has only men. Impressive. https://t.co/bXnQ4jo8jg â€” kamalika ghosh (@GhoshKamalika) October 26, 2018
There are apparently no women to represent Bollywood... https://t.co/Fc0Sm42ZtV â€” Rohan Sandhu (@Rohan_Sandhu) October 26, 2018</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
