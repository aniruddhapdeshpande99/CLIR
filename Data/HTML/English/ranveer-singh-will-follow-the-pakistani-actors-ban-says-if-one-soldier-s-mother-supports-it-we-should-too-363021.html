At an event, the Gully Boy actor was asked about his opinion on the Pakistani artist ban, to which he said,
‘ I am very cognisant that there is this school of thought that one should not mix art and sport with it, they are two different realms. But at the same time, us as artists and sportsmen, we are not sacrificing the same way that some of our compatriots are. Art and sports are different realms. The boundaries should be different.

But we are not sacrificing the way some of our compatriots are. If there's even one mother of a soldier who believes that we shouldn't engage, we should follow that&rdquo;. Ranveer clearly has won hearts with his sensible answer.
