Ever since, he's made a debut, Ranveer has always been a little extra. From his appearances, his choice of clothes, his constant PDAs with then girlfriend Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh is nothing like a conventional star.

This is also one of the main reasons why we love to love him. He was also one of the progressive actors to take up a condom brand for endorsements. Yes, a mainstream Bollywood actor endorses a condom brand to an Indian audience for the past 5 years now is GUTS.
And he openly celebrated sex and normalised this conversation in the country. From print ads, campaign to fun commercials, Ranveer Singh was all out promoting Durex. But looks like we won't see him endorsing the condom brand anymore

If reports are to be believed, the reason behind this might be his marriage with actress Deepika Padukone. The actor married his co-star and longtime girlfriend Deepika Padukone in November last year.

However, the report also suggests that the actor is demanding a higher fee for the endorsement and this could be a major reason for the end of this collaboration.
Durex had in fact even wished the newly wed couple also around their wedding.
But looks like this didn't really convince Deepika to give a go ahead to Ranveer Singh.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
