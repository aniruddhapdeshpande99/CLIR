Along with Kareena Kapoor, Kishore Pradhan’s stellar performance in one particular scene in the movie - when Kareena Kapoor misses her train and goes to him for help - made it quite popular. Besides Jab We Met, he has given impeccable performances in several other films including Lage Raho Munna Bhai. His roles in Hindi, as well as Marathi films, were much appreciated and loved.
Sadly, Kishore Pradhan has passed away at the age of 86. The veteran star breathed his last this morning.
Kishore Pradhan has acted in about 100 Marathi theatre plays and 18 English plays. He was last seen in Marathi film Subh Lagna Savdhaan.
It is said that he wasn’t keeping well since after he finished shooting for the film. In a statement to Indianexpress.com, his Subh Lagna Savdhaan co-star Subodh Bhave said, &ldquo;I don’t know the exact reason of his death yet. His family is grieving and busy with preparations for his funeral.&rdquo;
