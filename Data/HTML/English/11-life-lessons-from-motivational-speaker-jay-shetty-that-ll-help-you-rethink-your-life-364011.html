1. After you break up
There are a lot of times when a relationship leaves you heartbroken. According to a survey, couples are getting impatient about dealing with each other's problems and are not consistence in dating. So remember you are not alone dealing with a wounded heart. So remember this and shake it off.
2. If you fall in love too fast
It's okay. as long it happens organically, there's nothing to be afraid of. Not every relationship is the same, so experience it for its newness.
3. On preparing for failure
No one should decide your performance but you. If you lose some, win some. Nothing makes you a failure, it just becomes a learning curve. Whether your job is eating you up or your relationships are not long term, just know it's not you, it's always the situation.
4. On addiction and recovery
Nothing should become an addiction or obsession. Whether it's substance intake, relationship, or even a game on your phone. Don't let it rule your mind. Know your problem and work towards it before you need help.
5. If you're feeling drained, watch this
Take a break. Nothing is as important as you. No job, no person, no amount of money is bigger than your sanity and mental peace. So don't let materialistic things take that away from you. Take that pending vacation, be at home and do nothing. It's okay to laze around, you deserve it.
6. If you feel pressure
Don't let any amount of pressure upset you and over take you. Hold back because it's okay to say no to parties, dating or travel plans. It's okay to say no. Don't become a social mess and be all over. Take that time off to switch off and come back better. Learn to prioritise and people will prioritise you.
7. If they stop messaging
Learn to move on. You can't control someone's mind or feelings for you and you should not. It's okay to wait and give time. Don't be impulsive.
8. If you want to overcome your fears
Will you please believe in yourself? Take that leap of faith and challenge yourself and I promise you, you will feel amazing like never before. No relationship or person or job can give you a feeling of satisfaction the way you yourself can.
10. If you're drowning in information
Snap out. Too much or too less information can be hazardous. Don't overthink about your future. Let things unfurl at their own pace and you will see yourself in a more calmer zone.
11. If you feel lonely
You are not alone. We know it's easier said than done but it's really true. One out of three people face loneliness because of their fears. Learn to take up a skill or a craft and release your energies on excelling at that. Believe me, everything is a blessing.
12. Learn to let go
Invest your money in experience rather than things. This is a great way to of breaking the loneliness and materialism cycle. Schedule a time to talk to a friend. Take a class to learn something new. Volunteer to deepen your sense of purpose and spend time with people who look more like your future than past.
Before we sign off, just remember, delay is a blessing. So don't fret if things don't pace up your way. Believe in yourself and the world is yours.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
