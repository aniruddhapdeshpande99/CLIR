Article 15 of the Indian constitution prohibits decriminalisation on the grounds of caste, religion, race, sex or place of birth. Going by the title, looks like the film will address the address the issue discrimination, just like how Anubhav Sinha’s last film Mulk had. This one, reportedly, is Anubhav Sinha’s most ambitious project until date.
As Ayushmann Khurrana wrapped up the shoot of Article 15, he penned down an heartwarming note and called it most &ldquo;important&rdquo; and &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; film of Indian cinema.
Wrapped up a film which will become the most relevant and important film of Indian cinema. Thank you @anubhavsinha sir for giving me this gem and also writing the most real cop role ever. #Article15 pic.twitter.com/W4h83LLuko — Ayushmann Khurrana (@ayushmannk) April 9, 2019
Ayushamann is happy to have bagged the opportunity to work with Sinha. &ldquo;Anubhav Sinha is one such director who understands the complexities of our country. I loved Mulk. It was the most balanced film based on communalism and extremism and it will be an absolute pleasure to work with him on Article 15,&rdquo; he had earlier told IANS.
Thanks to the entire cast and crew, esp #RonjiniChakraborty and @Ashishsverma for this wonderful 3D mini model of mine. Love. It’s a wrap! #Article15 pic.twitter.com/wwn2JGgfgn — Ayushmann Khurrana (@ayushmannk) April 9, 2019
