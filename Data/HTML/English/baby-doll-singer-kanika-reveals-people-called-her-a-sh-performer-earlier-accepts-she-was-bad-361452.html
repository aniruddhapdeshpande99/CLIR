After she married NRI businessman at the age of 18 in 1997, she moved to London where she spent her days as a homemaker until one day when Meet Bros, her Rakhi brothers whom she has known since childhood, called her for an opportunity to sing a song for a movie.
From that day onwards, her life changed completely.

Ragini MMS 2 didn’t do quite well at box office, but Baby Doll was a chartbuster. Almost everyone was singing and dancing to its tunes.

She accepts she was a &ldquo;bad live performer&rdquo; earlier.
&ldquo;When I came to sing in Bollywood and my song became a superhit, I performed live on stage, and I was a bad live performer. Then, I learned the art of stage performance and now I am doing Kanika Kapoor Live across the globe.&rdquo;
Kanika Kapoor doesn’t believe she has a perfect voice. She says it's about connecting with the audiences.
&ldquo;Perfect is a myth. Nobody is perfect... It is about the connect, the human connection. If you are an artiste -- whether a storyteller, a singer, a dancer, you are the best when you are engaging with your audience. If you are singing a love song, the listener should feel like falling in love... and feel the emotion through the song.&quot;
Currently, Kanika Kapoor is busy in grooming new talent for the reality television show The Voice of India - Season 3, which will go on air on STAR Plus from Sunday.
