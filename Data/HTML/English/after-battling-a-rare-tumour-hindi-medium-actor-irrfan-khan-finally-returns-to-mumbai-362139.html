But now as per a close source in a leading daily, the Hindi Medium actor is back in town. While some are saying he's getting treated at a hospital in Mumbai, some are thinking Irrfan is returning back to movies and starting with the shooting of Hindi Medium's sequel.
A source close to the actor in IANS confirmed that the globally renowned star is back, but dismissed all other claims. &ldquo;Irrfan is back in Mumbai. But people are publishing all sorts of stories without any confirmation. They are not true,&rdquo; the source said.

&ldquo;I will get an update on his health and when will he be resuming work when I meet the actor soon,&rdquo; the source added. The actor was last seen in Karwaan which was about a road trip along with Dulquer Salmaan and Mithila Parker.
The movie that released in August last year, could not have the actor on-board for the promotions because of his treatment.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
