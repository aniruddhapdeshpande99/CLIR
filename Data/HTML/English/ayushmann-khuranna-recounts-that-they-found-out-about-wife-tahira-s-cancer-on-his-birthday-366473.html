Looking back at the stressful phase of his life, Ayushmann spoke to a leading channel about Tahira's illness. &ldquo;It was very difficult. In fact, thanks to her that she was brave enough to take that positively otherwise I would have broken, completely. Because I was in the middle of two films I was promoting Andhadhun and Badhaai Ho. And we got to know about this on my birthday. In fact, we saw Manmarziyaan that day... we saw Manmarziyaan on September 14 and we got to know of this disease.&quot;

&ldquo;She was like 'I want to just celebrate my life. I'll take it head on and we are together in this both fighting the disease and also in promoting the films.' So, it was a collective effort from both sides. But I am glad she's overcome this and as we speak she's giving a lecture on cancer, how to fight, how to combat it. She's a leader now to cancer patients and an inspiration,&quot; he added.
Tahira has time and again given interviews to various platforms talking about her emotional and physical journey and how she feels liberated after becoming bald.
