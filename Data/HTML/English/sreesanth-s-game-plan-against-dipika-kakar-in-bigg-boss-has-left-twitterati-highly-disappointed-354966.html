In last night’s episode as well, he attempted to walk out of the house in anger. It’s no surprise anymore that Sreesanth is the most aggressive contestant on the show and that he often loses his temper.
He was evicted from the show a few days ago, only to be kept in a secret room along with Anup Jalota. After having watched other contestants play the game and seeing their true and real side, Sreesanth is not only against Dipika Kakar, who he calls his elder sister, but is also plotting the entire game against her with the help of other contestants.
This, apparently, isn’t going down well with the fans, who are calling out Sreesanth for playing a bad game on Twitter.
#Sreesanth even now says that he wants to go home but when he was chosen by #DipikaKakkar, he blames her for choosing him. He is losing his self respect more and more by continuing the show. #BiggBoss #BiggBoss12 #BB #BB12 — Nikhil Reddy #MovieManiac (@sainikhilreddy7) October 16, 2018

This season is all about SreeSanth and Dipika but both of them doesn’t have Winner qualities!!! Horrible season 🤮#BB12 #BiggBoss12 — H. (@PaigesAngel_) October 17, 2018
#Sreesanth ne socha tha ke hm Drama create kar le @ms_dipika ke against kar denge sabko lekin jab task shuru hua to #Sree ko laga ye to bhari pad gaya is liye party badal li, aur #DipikaKakar ko support kar diya. #WeSupportDipikaKakar @BiggBoss #BiggBoss12 — Ehtisham Farooqui (@etifarooqui) October 17, 2018
Actually I supported Sree so much last week because he was willing to play the game ... and expose Dipika's fakeness ...
but again he is saying gaalis and trying to run away after small instigation from Romil ... #bb12 very annoying — JC Miller (@JCMiller8720) October 17, 2018
