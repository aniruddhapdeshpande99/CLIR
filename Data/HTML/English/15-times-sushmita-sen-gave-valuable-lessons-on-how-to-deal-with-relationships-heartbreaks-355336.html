The ultimate beauty with brains and every man’s dream date, Sushmita Sen has made time stop with her ageless beauty – that lies within her and on the outside too – in her thoughts and on her face as well.
She is single, strong, smart, sassy, independent, happy and proud of her own self. At a point of time when almost everyone is suffering from relationship woes, Sushmita Sen is a happy single mother.
&ldquo;Why Single?&rdquo;, you ask, and she says, &ldquo;Why not? I am secure in my choice and in being so, I can respect and appreciate another’s choice, whatever it may be. After all, singles or doubles, we play to win. As for me let’s just say, ‘I am yet to meet that sire, who loves to play with fire.&rdquo;
