From moving on and working with their ex-partners to maintaining a cordial relationship with someone you don't share a pleasant past with, there's a lot that happens between the actors.
However, lately, there has been a significant change as people are more accepting and welcoming now.
For instance, even though Katrina and Deepika have a history of unpleasant past, things have become warm between the two actors. Katrina even turned up for Ranveer and Deepika's wedding reception, proving that all's well that end's well.
Ranveer was at a chat show where he was quizzed about the awkwardness that people face when their past meets their present. There were several reports of Anushka and Ranveer and Anushka dating after the release of Band Baaja Baraat but things didn't work out. They parted ways as a couple but they maintained a professional relationship as they came together for Ladies v/s Ricky Bahl and Dil Dhadakne Do.
Ranveer Singh recently made a candid confession at a celebrity talk show. Ranveer said that both Katrina and Anushka attending the reception was really warm and beautiful.
