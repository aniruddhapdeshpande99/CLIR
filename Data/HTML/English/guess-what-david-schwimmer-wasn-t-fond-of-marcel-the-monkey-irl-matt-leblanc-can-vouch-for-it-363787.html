Actor Matt LeBlanc, who played the role of Joey Tribbiani in the show, is &quot;Friends&quot; with co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer and Lisa Kudrow, but there's one star of the show that holds a place in the actor's heart: Marcel the Monkey.

&ldquo;I liked the monkey. I like animals. The monkey was really cool,&rdquo; he said, adding that not everyone was a fan of the monkey whose real name is Katie.

&ldquo;Schwimmer not so much. He's the one that had to work with it the most, so he was like, 'Again with the monkey?,&rdquo; he added.

LeBlanc recalled that once when they were shooting on the sound stage and the monkey climbed up the lights to the ceiling and disappeared into the blackness. &quot;It took half an hour,&quot; he remembered. &quot;They're waving mealworms.&quot; No matter the mayhem, the actor didn't mind the capuchin.
