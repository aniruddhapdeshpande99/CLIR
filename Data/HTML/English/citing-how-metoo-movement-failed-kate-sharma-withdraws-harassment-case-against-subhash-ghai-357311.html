&ldquo;People are really making fun of the entire #MeToo campaign. Nothing has happened, nobody has been arrested. If cops are only busy registering FIRs, then what is the use of this entire campaign? Tell me, how many people have been arrested? Cops asked me if I wanted to register an FIR, but I don’t see any reason for moving ahead to get justice as whatever I had to say is in the public domain. We (Ghai and her) were very good friends, but he destroyed everything; I’ve said this publicly and I’m saying it again. I am fed up of everything, hence I have withdrawn my case.&rdquo;</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
