&ldquo;When you meet someone from the motherland... This is definitely how Punjabis greet each other, complete with a five-minute long hand holding session and family tree check-in. To be honest, Diljit and I aren’t even acting... someone was just rolling when we met up,&rdquo; she wrote.
In the video, Lilly can be seen formally shaking hands with the foreigners, but when she sees Diljit, she gets carried away and starts talking to him in Punjabi. From asking about each others’ health to relatives, Diljit and Lilly engage in a funny Punjabi conversation. Watch the video right here:
