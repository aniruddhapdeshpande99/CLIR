Be it her divorce or her relationship with Arjun Kapoor, Malaika has dealt with every decision in her life very gracefully.\nMalaika appeared on Kareena Kapoor Khan's radio show Ishq FM where she opened up on her divorce and revealed how she was advised by people to not go ahead with the decision. She said,\n\u201cNobody really encourages you to go right ahead. Even the night before the divorce, I had my family sit with me and ask me, are you sure? I heard this all along and perhaps rightly so because these are people who worry and care for you.\u201d\n(Also read: Malaika's Spain Trip Is A Full On Fam-Jam And It Proves Not All Celebrity Divorces Are Messy!)\nDon't Miss 24.3 K SHARES 17 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES 9.5 K SHARES 8.9 K SHARES\nShe further added that there were people who called her a \u2018brave woman\u2019 and those who were proud of her decision. \u201cThat made me really happy.\u201d She adds,\n\u201cIf you are in an unhappy marriage and that\u2019s what you decide to do you should do it with a lot of dignity, self-respect. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you that you are any less of a woman. With me, I could sense that a lot of people were like, how the hell did you pull it off?\u201d\nShe explains that it's comparatively easier for men to move on with their lives post divorce than women. She adds,\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest disparity there is among all the other disparities there are which women have to face. It\u2019s never easy. As humans we start to blame other people. But for me, happiness is the most important. Arbaaz and I weighed pros and cons, we thought about a lot of things and then arrived at that decision. We just realised we\u2019ll be better people because together we were just making each other and everybody around us really unhappy.\u201d\nTalking about moving on and why women should get into the dating scene again, Malaika said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. Swipe left, right, whatever it might be! Have fun! For the first time in your life, you will also discover a kind of freedom. To be in a bed all alone is also a new feeling!\u201d", "description": "After her divorce with Arbaaz Khan, Malaika Arora is in a happy space as she is reportedly dating actor Arjun Kapoor.
