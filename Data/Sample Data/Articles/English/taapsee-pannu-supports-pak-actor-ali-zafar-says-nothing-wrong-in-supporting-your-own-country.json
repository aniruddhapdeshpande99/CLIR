All the Pakistani actors are been banned and vice versa. Actors like Ali Zafar, Mahira Khan are strongly supporting their country Pakistan, but they are being trolled, especially Ali. He was mercilessly trolled for supporting his own country.\nTwitter\nTaapsee Pannu who has been his co star came out in his support and said, \u201c I don\u2019t understand this. Do you expect him, being a Pakistani, to support a country he is not a part of?\u201d She further adds, \u201cHe has already been banned and we are all fine with it but how will it be if I am supporting my country and Pakistanis are trolling me, which they are now when I have tweeted about the Pulwama terror attack. What do you expect?\u201d\nTwitter\nShe even says it\u2019s obvious for him to support his own country,\n\u201cIt\u2019s his country. [If he doesn\u2019t support his PM], he will be trolled otherwise. We are trolled here when we don\u2019t celebrate our victories. It is stupid to expect him to do anything else. It\u2019s not like he is not able to work because he is banned in India. He is working there and will. He needs to celebrate his country\u2019s achievements and so do we and we are doing that. Obviously, he will support his country. What\u2019s wrong in that?\u201d\nTwitter\nDon't Miss 364 SHARES 466 SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 30.9 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\nWell, let's hope we can find a solution instead of attacking one another.", "description": "The current relationship between India and Pakistan is not very cordial after the Pulwama attack.
