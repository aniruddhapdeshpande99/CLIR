He thinks that as an industry, only stupidity dominates, making it harder for actors to be smart. The actor says today there are at least a handful people trying to push the envelope, which was not the case earlier.\nTalking to PTI, Emraan said,\nInstagram\n\u201cIt is difficult being a smart actor in Bollywood. Stupidity goes a long way here. The audience is smart but not too many producers and directors take that (risk) and understand that. Now at least we have the new blood coming up with new stuff.\"\nTalking about the audience which has become more intelligent, he added,\nAgencies\n\u201cBack then, it was just about making escapist films with a star, do what a star is supposed to do and get bums on seats. Right now, the audience wants to see more than that.\"\nJust to jog your memory a little Emraan started his career in mid-2000s, gaining fame for featuring in films which were dubbed bold.\nHowever, he carefully chose his projects and eventually shed the serial-kisser tag with films such as Shanghai, Ghanchakkar and Ek Thi Daayan among others. However, Emraan says before he turned towards edgier content, he was \u201cstuck\u201d in a zone for a long time.\nDon't Miss 24.3 K SHARES 17 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES 9.5 K SHARES 8.9 K SHARES\nAgencies\n\u201cInitially you can\u2019t voice your concerns because scripts choose you rather than you choosing scripts. When one thing works, they just stretch that to make them work again and again. Producers see it as safety net, a cash register. Where the audience is expected not to ask questions. Then I met filmmakers and producers who wanted to challenge me as an actor.\u201d\nEmraan says, if 2018 is anything to go by, where pure star-driven films did not work, good concept is the need of the hour. He adds,\nAgencies\n\u201cBecause of the influence of the web, the audience knows what they\u2019re missing out on here. They want lap up any mediocre content. Right now a handful of actors are doing a variety of things. The audience doesn\u2019t want to see a star-driven vehicle. They want to see another dimension of you, not you wearing the same urban clothes in a foreign location with 50 background dancers.\u201d\n(With agency inputs)", "description": "Emraan Hashmi finds it difficult to be a smart actor in Bollywood, says \u2018Stupidity goes a long way here\u2019 Emraan Hashmi says earlier, films were all about escapism.
