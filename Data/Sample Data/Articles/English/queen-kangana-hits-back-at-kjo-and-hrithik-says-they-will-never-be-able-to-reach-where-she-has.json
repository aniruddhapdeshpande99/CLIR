It won't be wrong to say that she has repeatedly been snubbed and boycotted by the so-called A-listers of the film fraternity.\nShe took a stand for herself and released her film Manikarnika on her own terms and conditions. Despite the cloud of negativity and controversies hovering around her project, the film managed to claim the status of a blockbuster.\n(Also read: 7 Controversial Statements By Kangana Ranaut, After The Release Of Manikarnika, That Define Her)\nYesterday Ranaut was speaking at the India Today Annual conclave where she was again in her unabashed avatar. Here are some of the excerpts of her conversation.\n1. She suggested a dose of chyawanprash for Karan Johar.\n\u201cKaran mocked me on the IIFA stage and said that I am jobless and I am looking for jobs from him or something like that. I mean, look at my talent and look at your movies. I mean, really? He really called me jobless on some platform? I think some people need a dose of chyawanprash.\u201d\nDon't Miss 8.9 K SHARES 24.3 K SHARES 17 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES 9.5 K SHARES\n2. Despite all the negligence and snubbing from her own fraternity members, she admitted that she doesn't feel left out.\nShe added, \u201cI really feel I stand out. When you talk about actresses, here\u2019s a three-time National Award-winning actress. The Mr Johars of the world try to present a list of people whose acting abilities are questionable. It\u2019s brain-feeding of another magnitude.\u201d\n3. She also spoke about her controversial episode with Hrithik Roshan\n\u201cTalking about this so-called case which never actually happened, here\u2019s a person I have worked with in two films. He is completely denying even knowing me and getting away with it. How does that even happen? This is absurd. Even to think that you can get away with something like that is in itself a sign of powerdrunkness.\u201d\n4. When she was asked if she would be interested in swapping places with Karan and Hrithik, she said,\n\u201cHe will never be where I am. I come from a situation where I really do not have a backup plan. I don\u2019t have a plan B. It\u2019s not like I wake up in the morning and think about \u2018Oh wait a minute. How many people can I offend today and how to make my life difficult?\u2019 That\u2019s not how it is.\n5. During her interaction, she also added that feminism is a misused word for a lot of reasons. She said,\n\u201cFeminism is a word which is misused and especially in today\u2019s time and age. I know so many people who know nothing about equality and they wear these badges of feminism, pay parity and fighting cause...,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t go by the book definition of feminism. I have made my own definition. Though the word is derived from feminine but why should there be only equalities which is influenced by or related to sex. There should be equality of life... I think with time we need to evolve the definition.\"", "description": "She took a stand for herself and released her film Manikarnika on her own terms and conditions.
