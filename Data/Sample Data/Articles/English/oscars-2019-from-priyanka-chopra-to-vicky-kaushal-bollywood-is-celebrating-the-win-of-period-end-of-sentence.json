End Of Sentence has real Padman Arunachalam Muruganathan talking about the menstruation in this documentary.\nMenstruation continues to be taboo in many parts of the world, not just India. Due to the lack of conversation about it and the unavailability of hygienic products to a large chunk of women, menstruation is often punctuated with illnesses, infections and inconvenience. While a film cannot change that overnight, the hope is that it will accelerate this conversation all over the world.", "description": "Right now every Indian cinema lover is talking about Period.
