Looks like this was just the starting point of some more collaborations between Bappi Da and Marvel Studios! Well, yes! According to an agency report, the Indian veteran singer-composer says he is in talks with Marvel Studios for one of their upcoming movies.\nOver the years, some of the Indian elements have managed to find their way in Marvel superhero films. Remember Robert Downey Jr.'s character Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) attending an Indian wedding in Spider-Man: Homecoming or the Indian slum scenes in The Avengers?\nAnd now, if things work out, then one of Bappi Lahiri's songs will feature in a Marvel film.\nPinterest\n\"I am currently in talks with Marvel Studios. They had used my song Jhoom jhoom jhoom baba. Chris Pratt, the hero of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2, had really liked the song. So maybe a song (by me) will be used in their next film. I will go to Hollywood in April,\" Bappi told IANS in a telephonic interview.\nDon't Miss 248 SHARES 24.3 K SHARES 17 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES 9.5 K SHARES\nBappi Da's Golden-time?
