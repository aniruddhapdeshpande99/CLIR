It isn't too difficult to decipher that the actor we are referring to here is Alia Bhatt.\nShe was targeted for nepotism when she entered and made her debut with Karan Johar's Student Of The Year but with her sheer hard-work and diverse choice of films, she proved that she was born to act!\nWhile she is basking in the success of her last release Gully Boy, she has already been roped in to play world\u2019s first woman amputee-mountaineer Arunima Sinha in her upcoming biopic.\nA Peeping Moon report claims that Alia has already given her official nod for the film that will be based on Arunima\u2019s book Born Again On The Mountain: A Story of Losing Everything And Finding It Back.\nWho is Arunima?\nShe is the first female amputee to scale Mount Everest and Mount Vinson. She turned one of the biggest tragedies of her life into an opportunity to scale great heights. Arunima was a national level volleyball player who was struggling and fighting with a gang of robbers, who in turn pushed her from a running train in 2011.\nDon't Miss 8.9 K SHARES 1.2 K SHARES 2.3 K SHARES 24.3 K SHARES 17 K SHARES\nTwitter\nAs a result, one of her legs had to be amputated below the knee.\nBut she still managed to climb all the continents' highest peaks and hoist the national flag of India.

She completed her final summit of Mount Vinson in Antarctica on 4 January 2019.\nThe report quotes a source as saying,\n\u201cArunima\u2019s life has been an inspiration to many across the globe and what she has managed isn\u2019t just an ordinary feat. When makers approached her to make a film on her and told her they were planning to get Alia on board, she was excited.\u201d\nThe source adds that Alia is yet to lock the dates because of her packed schedule but she will soon be finalizing the dates, which most likely will be after the shoot of Takht next year.\nAfter Kalank, Brahmastra and Takht, this might be yet another Dharma Productions film where Alia will be seen headlining the project.", "description": "While she is basking in the success of her last release Gully Boy, she has already been roped in to play world\u2019s first woman amputee-mountaineer Arunima Sinha in her upcoming biopic.
