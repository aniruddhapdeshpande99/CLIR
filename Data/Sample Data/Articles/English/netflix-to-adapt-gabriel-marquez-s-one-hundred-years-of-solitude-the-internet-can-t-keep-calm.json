Penned by Colombian author Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's, the magical novel has finally been acquired by the streaming giant for adaptation.\nThe book will be adapted into a Spanish-language series and filmed largely in the Nobel prize-winning author's home country of Colombia, with Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's sons, Rodrigo Garc\u00eda and Gonzalo Garc\u00eda Barcha, serving as executive producers, reported The Guardian.\nGarc\u00eda said that his father was skeptical of the sprawling magical realist novel's capacity to fit within a traditional film structure, and wanted the story to be told in Spanish.\n\"For decades, our father was reluctant to sell the film rights to 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' because he believed that it could not be made under the time constraints of a feature film, or that producing it in a language other than Spanish would not do it justice,\" Garc\u00eda said.\n\"But in the current golden age of series, with the level of talented writing and directing, the cinematic quality of content, and the acceptance by worldwide audiences of programs in foreign languages, the time could not be better.\"\nDon't Miss 201 SHARES 253 SHARES 24.3 K SHARES 17 K SHARES 11.2 K SHARES\nInternet is too excited about the new development.
