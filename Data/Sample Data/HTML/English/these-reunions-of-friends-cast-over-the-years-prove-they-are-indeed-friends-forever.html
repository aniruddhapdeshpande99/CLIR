Well, FRIENDS is one of the best TV shows and people who have an opinion that contradicts with this one are the ones who haven't watched it. No matter how bad a day gets, there is nothing in life that can't be fixed with an episode of FRIENDS.

It's an antidote to monotony of life. It's been more than a decade that the show ended but the madness around Joey, Phoebe, Monica and Chandler still remains the same.

They redefined friendship goals and gave us important lessons in life.
From why Joey Doesn't Share Food to Ross' crazy obsession with the sandwich that his boss ends up finishing- the show gave us endless memorable moments that we will remember forever.

As much as we love the show, the cast of the show too is attached to the show that made their careers! From Courtney Cox to Jennifer Aniston, the Friends stars are friends in real-life and their mini-reunions over the years have proved that: They will indeed be there for each other-FOREVER.
Recently, Courteney Cox took to social media and posted a photograph with Jennifer Aniston and the fans had a mini deja-vu! The internet couldn't handle the Monica-Rachel PDA and they dropped some really adorable lovey-dovey comments on their bond!
The thing that caught people's attention was Monica's caption for Rachel :
&ldquo;The world definitely got brighter the day this girl was born. Happy birthday sweetheart! I Love you!&rdquo;
The cast is still connected and they bond often when they meet for personal and work commitments.
