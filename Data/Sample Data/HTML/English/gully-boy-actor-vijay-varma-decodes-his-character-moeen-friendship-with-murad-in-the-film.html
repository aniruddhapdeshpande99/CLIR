Vijay Varma hails from Hyderabad and after acting in plays, he took a big decision and moved to Pune where he studied in FTII and eventually Mumbai to pursue his passion for starring in films.
If we go back and trace his journey, he acted in a short film Shor which was later adapted into a feature Shor in the City. He starred in variety of films including his negative role in PINK, Chittagong, Monsoon Shootout and most recently his short film Counterfeit Kunkoo was given the nomination of the Short Film Grand Jury prize at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.But one key turning point in his life came in the form of an opportunity that Zoya Akhtar offered him.
He slipped into the character of Gully Boy as Moeen so effortlessly that despite all the grey shades to his character, you can't leave the theater hating him.

I spoke to him about his character Moeen and he patiently takes me back in time describing how he made Zoya and Kagti's character more subtle than it actually was.
Here are the excerpts.
First of all-Gully Boy is a certified hit and you are being googled and talked about. Your thoughts?
VV: &quot;It's amazing to receive validation and it feels really good. I just want to focus on taking meaningful roles. I want to create more characters and roles that people are able to resonate with.&quot;
How Zoya and Reema created the real world of Gully Boy:
&quot;I think the script is the real winner here. Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar have done a wonderful job of penning everything down. The world of Gully Boy that you see on the big screen is the actual reflection of what Zoya had penned down. In the script, they had all the characters in place. Mine was a story of an underdog and being one in real-life helped me to modify and improve my character. The story is real because: Even though we all are speaking Bambiya , it’s not what you see in the other movies because the dialogue-writer of the film Vijay Maurya added every detail. They involved real people from that area so that we know how they actually speak and function. When somebody approaches work in such a real manner, it becomes everyone’s duty to contribute and find real arcs to each and every character.&quot;
The inception Of 'Moeen':
VV: &quot;I received a phone-call for a screen-test. I had to prepare two scenes from the film and I had to prepare that. After I played it out, Zoya Akhtar liked it. I was called by her and after I met her, she started shooting me from her camera to check how I fit in, in the Gully Boy world. We did a couple of scenes again and then I was locked. It was a big moment of achievement in itself because I have been a huge admirer of their work-including Zoya, Ranveer and Alia Bhatt. I was feeling fortunate that I have been zeroed down to play an eminent character with such incredible powerhouses of talent. So it was a moment of absolute joy.&quot;
The Challenges of playing a multi-dimensional character
VV: &quot;The biggest challenge for me was to figure who Moeen really is. I wanted to see his graph. There are so many layers to the character that you get to see throughout the film that every aspect had to be understood. There are multiple sides to his personality and my major concern was to build a thread of the character so that it works smoothly. I was very particular about pulling a character like Moeen in a way that it should look believable and people shouldn’t question me even at a single point that his character doesn’t fit well.
I wanted to make it look convincing. There is a garage boy profession he has-he is stealing cars-there is a mysterious nature of his work but he is very enterprising. Even though he is doing unlawful things but he is also an understanding friend to Moeen. The transition had to be smooth.
On one hand, he’s stealing cars but there is a scene when he plays a loyal friend to Murad and tells him to reveal the truth to Safeena. He has a moral compass of his own and even though it might not match with people’s thought process, you can’t completely disown or reject the character.
The hilarious Benetton Scene: The scene where Moeen breaks into an impromptu rap was Ranveer's master-mind
VV: &quot;The Benetton scene was already written. And there is a reason why that scene has been placed like that. In the beginning, there is a scene where the entire area is seen celebrating a new job that the boy has got. Just to show how friends function that the boy will take all his friend either when the store is shut or going to be shut just to show that I work here. And in the middle of the scene, the rapper boys discover this huge opportunity that has come their way. So it’s all written and just because Moeen doesn’t understand anything about the rapping world-the only thing he gets is that it’s a contest and the winners will get 10 lakh rupees in the end so he shows his joy by breaking into an impromptu gig. That was what was written. Breaking into that gig was Ranveer’s idea. He said that &ldquo;Idhar Toh Moeen Bhai Ko Fail Jaana Chahiye…&rdquo; The scene had everyone in the splits-even when we were shooting. This Benetton scene actually made Moeen very endearing. Mine and Murad’s equation in the film is totally a Krishna-Sudama kind of thing and it has shown in the film as well.&quot;
Working With Ranveer and how it helped in creating Murad-Moeen's endearing bond:
A fact that not many wouldn’t know is that the script wasn’t written in a way that Moeen and Murad would end up being the best of friends. I think it happened over time. We both were vibing beautifully in the film. Even though the character of Moeen was written in a way that he’s all tough but since I am not tough in real-life, I gave this subtle shade to the character. After reading the script, I thought that Moeen has the capability of ruining Murad with one bad decision as one has a dream and is ambitious but other is just surviving.
And, about Ranveer-He’s an extremely loving and giving as a person. There is this very receptive and calm side to him which I saw when I worked with him. I will always remember his as Murad because the moments we shared in the film were very real.
The most touching validation after the release:
VV: &quot;It was when I was at the Gaiety Theatre in Mumbai along with Zoya. After the release, I called Zoya and told her I wanted to meet her and give her a hug for making the film and making me such an integral part of it. She said she was at Gaiety and that’s when I rushed to meet her. After meeting her, I saw some bits of the second half and the audience’s reaction- I was overwhelmed with the response. I think there is no greater validation for an actor but to see the audience reacting in such a positive manner. The whole euphoria of watching the film was a dream come true. The audience was rooting and maaoring whistles on the scene and I was elated.&quot;
He will soon be seen in Anurag Kashyap’s next production - Bamfad which marks the debut of Paresh Rawal’s son and Bollywood debut of Shalini Pandey who was last seen in Telugu blockbuster film Arjun Reddy.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
