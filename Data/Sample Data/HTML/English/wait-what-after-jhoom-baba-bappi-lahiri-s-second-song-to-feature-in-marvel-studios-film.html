Well, that was just a beginning. Looks like this was just the starting point of some more collaborations between Bappi Da and Marvel Studios! Well, yes! According to an agency report, the Indian veteran singer-composer says he is in talks with Marvel Studios for one of their upcoming movies.
Over the years, some of the Indian elements have managed to find their way in Marvel superhero films. Remember Robert Downey Jr.'s character Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) attending an Indian wedding in Spider-Man: Homecoming or the Indian slum scenes in The Avengers?
And now, if things work out, then one of Bappi Lahiri's songs will feature in a Marvel film.

&quot;I am currently in talks with Marvel Studios. They had used my song Jhoom jhoom jhoom baba. Chris Pratt, the hero of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2, had really liked the song. So maybe a song (by me) will be used in their next film. I will go to Hollywood in April,&quot; Bappi told IANS in a telephonic interview.

Bappi Da's Golden-time? Hell, yes!

While he is yet to sign on the dotted line for the Marvel association, his other international collaborations with rapper Snoop Dogg and singer Akon are complete. He added that acting has also been keeping him busy. He recently made a cameo in Sony Entertainment Television's show Ladies Special.
&quot;I have acted in so many films, including Kalakaar. I had done Indian Idol, but this (Ladies Special) is the first time that I worked on a TV show. It's today's story about women travelling by a train and making friends during their journey,&quot; he said.
The artiste with about a 50-year-long career has even been a film director. After helming a documentary called &quot;We are One&quot;, he is set to direct a musical. &quot;This year, I am directing a movie titled Ek Adhura Sangeet,&quot; said Bappi.
What about a film about his life?
Twitter
&quot;Yes, a lot of people are approaching me to make a film on my life but I haven't finalised anything. The biopic should start by this year,&quot; he said. He went on to nominating Ranveer Singh to act. He added,
&quot;Actor Ranveer Singh could probably play my younger version...you know the 1970s, 80' and 90s time.&quot;
