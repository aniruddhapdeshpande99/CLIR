Pakistan said that it carried out &ldquo;&quot;strikes across Line of Control from within Pakistani airspace&quot;, but &ldquo;it was not retaliation or escalation&rdquo;. They just wanted to demonstrate that they are fully prepared.
When Indian airforce also retaliated to this, in the battle, Pakistani F-16 was downed by an IAF Mig 21 Bis aircraft, but IAF also lost a Mig-21. The Indian government confirmed that an Indian Air Force (IAF) Wing Commander piloting a MiG-21 fighter jet has not returned after Pakistan claimed that it had arrested IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan.
