In the worst-ever terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir since terrorism erupted in the 1980s, a suicide bomber on February 14 rammed his SUV packed with explosives into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district, killing at least 40 troopers. Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed later claimed responsibility for the attack.
Apart from that, makers of several upcoming films have taken a stand and decided not to release their films in Pakistan. Giving her two cents on the ban of Pakistani artists in India, actress Vidya Balan on Friday said a strong stand needs to be taken this time.

&quot;Though I have always believed that art should be kept away from all boundaries and politics, I think we have to take a stand now. Enough is enough.&quot;
Vidya was further quizzed if art should be kept away from politics, to which she responded,
&quot;As an individual I believe that there is no better way to bring people together than arts, be it music, poetry, dance, theatre, cinema or any other art form. But this time I think we should just take a break from this practice and see what can be done for the future. As I said, some tough calls have to be taken at some point.&quot;
On the professional front, Vidya is all geared up to experiment as an artist and will soon be seen hosting a radio show as a radio jockey.
