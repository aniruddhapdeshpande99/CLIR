Just to jog your memory a little, this stems from the very fact that Ajay Devgn and Kajol's 15-year-old daughter Nysa and 8-year-old son Yug, get a lot of media attention and are often targeted by social media trolls.
Devgn was promoting his upcoming film Total Dhamaal when he explained why social media users should not judge his children.
&quot;Judge me, but don't judge my kids. Kajol and I are the actors, judge us...it's because of us, our children are under the spotlight every time. &quot;Being judgmental about someone is not a good thing. If I start passing judgement on someone, that person would obviously feel bad...so do my children. Honestly speaking, those people don't really matter. But I feel bad sometimes when my kids go through such harsh trolling.&quot; the actor said to IANS.
A lot of times, Ajay's daughter Nysa gets trolled and body-shamed for her airport look and this was not the first time she was targeted. When asked about how her daughter deals with such harsh comments, Devgn said,
&quot;She used to get upset over trolling earlier, but now she doesn't care about it anymore.' She knows how to deal with it. She has accepted that there will be some people who will keep judging no matter what.&quot;
On how to tackle trolls, he said,
&quot;Avoid it... If you will react, they will react more and this will continue. So better to stop fighting against trollers.&quot;
On the work front, Ajay Devgn is currently promoting his upcoming film- Indra Kumar's Total Dhamaal.
