&quot;I am not secretive, but I don't feel the need to say things out loud. I don't need to make an announcement about who I'm dating. It's up to me to decide when and what I want to share about my personal life, and it is up to the audience to decide how they look at it. How much information I want to put out in the public domain is my prerogative.&quot;
A few months ago, a news report had quoted a source close to a couple saying,

After all the cryptic interviews, looks like Shibani and Farhan are serious about taking the next step together!
