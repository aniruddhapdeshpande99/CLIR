After The Release Of GoT Season 8's Kickass Trailer, It’s Raining Memes & Jokes On The Internet
It came late but it was worth the wait. Finally, after a wait for two long years, HBO unveiled the Game Of Thrones season 8 trailer. There’s going to be a huge battle, and all your favourite characters are already prepping up for it. It’s going to be a battle between the dead and the living.

&quot;Our enemy doesn't tire, doesn't stop, doesn't feel,&quot; says Jon Snow in the trailer. He is indeed talking about the Night King, whose glimpse wasn’t even shown in the trailer. Yet, it had a lot for Game Of Thrones fans to ponder on.

We have watched the trailer a dozen times already. Can you get over it? Well, looks like no one can. Now, fans have turned the trailer into jokes and memes, and it couldn’t have got more hilarious. Take a look!

I figured it out. Cersei knows Arya is alive and has sent The Mountain to kill her. She is running from Gregor and he is just about to end her then The Hound steps in to save her. Cleganebowl begins. Hype. #GameofThrones pic.twitter.com/VfQmg46vM2 — Lady Stoneheart (@LSHNorthAF) March 6, 2019

Me: I hope all #GameofThrones plot lines resolve themselves in a satisfying manner, and that none of my favourite characters die.
