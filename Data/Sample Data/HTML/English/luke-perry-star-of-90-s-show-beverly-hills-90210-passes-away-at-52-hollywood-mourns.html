The actor's hospitalisation coincided with the day Fox announced the reboot of &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; with the original cast scheduled for a reappearance, though Perry was not believed to return.
Perry was born as Coy Luther Perry to Ann Bennett and Coy Luther Perry Jr, a steelworker, on October 11, 1966 in Ohio.

Before becoming an actor, Perry worked in an asphalt paving company. His earliest roles were in &quot;Loving&quot; (198788) and &quot;Another World&quot; (198889).
In his breakout show &quot;Beverly Hills&quot;, which ran from 1990 to 2000, Perry played the brooding, suave high school student Dylan McKay.
The series followed the lives and romantic entanglements of a group of teenagers living in an affluent area of Los Angeles. The role made him a global superstar and a teenage idol.
&quot;I'm going to be linked with him until I die, but that's actually just fine. I created Dylan McKay. He's mine,&quot; Perry was once quoted as saying about his career-defining role.
The actor's most recent stint was on The CW's comic book adaptation &quot;Riverdale&quot;, in which he portrayed Fred Andrews, the father of show's protagonist Archie Andrews.
His last cinematic outing would be Quentin Tarantino's ninth directorial &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in the lead. The film will release in July this year.
Shortly after the news of his death broke, Perry's &quot;90210&quot; co-stars -- Ian Ziering, Jennie Garth, Shannon Doherty and Gabrielle Carteris -- were among the first to pay tributes to the actor.

&quot;Dearest Luke - I am so heart broken and at a loss for words. You my friend were a mighty soul and have left your mark. My love and prayers to the family and all who loved you. RIP,&quot; Carteris wrote on Twitter.
Ziering posted a photo of himself with Perry on Instagram and captioned it, &quot;Dearest Luke, I will forever bask in the loving memories we've shared over the last thirty years.&quot;
&quot;May your journey forward be enriched by the magnificent souls who have passed before you, just like you have done here for those you leave behind. God please give him a seat close to to you, he deserves it,&quot; he added.
In a statement to Entertainment Weekly, Garth said she is feeling heartbroken.&quot;He meant so much to so many. Such a very special person. I share my deep sadness with his family and all who loved him. Such a terrible loss,&quot; she added.
Doherty said, &quot;I am in shock. Heartbroken. Devastated by the loss of my friend. I have so many memories with Luke that make me smile and that are forever imprinted on my heart and mind.&quot;

Actors Sarah Michelle Geller, Rosario Dawson and DiCaprio also condoled Perry's death.
&quot;Luke Perry was a kindhearted and incredibly talented artist. It was an honour to be able to work with him. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his loved ones,&quot; DiCaprio posted on Twitter.
Geller, who starred in TV show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, based on Perry's 1992 horror comedy of the same name, shared a photo of hers with the actor on Instagram.
&quot;My entire high school experience was shaped by Brenda and Dylan. Now I have to hold my dear friend @theshando hand, while she mourns the loss of #lukeperry This is not how it's supposed to happen. I hope his family knows many lives he touched. 'I chose. I chose you. I want you. I've always wanted you' - my favourite quote,&quot; she wrote in the caption.
Dawson tweeted, &quot;Luke Perry. My teen crush. I'm glad I got to tell you. Sheepishly red faced and all. You were lovely and you gave great hugs. Grateful to witness and experience your kindness and warmth. #RestInPeace love. Blessings to your family.&quot;
&quot;Riverdale&quot; creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa described Perry as &quot;a father, brother, friend and mentor&quot;. &quot;So heartbroken about Luke. He was a father, brother, friend, and mentor. Each night before he had to shoot a scene, he'd call me and we'd talk about... Everything. I will miss those calls. And my heart goes out to all his family and friends,&quot; he wrote.
Meanwhile, the production on the next season of &quot;Riverdale&quot; was halted in the wake of Perry's death.
