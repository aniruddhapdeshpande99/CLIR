Condemning the attack, she said, &quot;I think people over here shouldn't show off that they really care for the nation. If they want to express their grief, then they should spend their time with the martyrs' families. I have also been associated with them in my constituency.

People should contribute financially towards their families instead of creating havoc here. What will they get by doing all this nonsense?&quot;
