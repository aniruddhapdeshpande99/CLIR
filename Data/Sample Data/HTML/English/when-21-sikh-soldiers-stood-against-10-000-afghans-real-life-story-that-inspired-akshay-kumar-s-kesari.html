And when it comes to courage and valour, Sikh Regiment is one of the most decorated in the country.

Akshay Kumar plays Havildar Ishar Singh, the leader of the regiment called 36th Sikhs, which was stationed in Saragarhi, a small village which is now in Pakistan. The area was frequently invaded by Afghans. On the day of battle, 10,000 men attacked the village. Since the British headquarters said that the army will take time to arrive, the Sikh men had to take the matter into their hands.

The battle of Saragarhi took place in the 19th century on 12th September 1897, which is called the Great Game. The name was given owing to the heightened tensions between Britain and Russia as they battled over territories in central Asia, including Afghanistan.
