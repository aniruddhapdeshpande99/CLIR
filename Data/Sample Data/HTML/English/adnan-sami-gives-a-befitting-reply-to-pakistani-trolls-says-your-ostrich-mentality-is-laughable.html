In a tweet, he told the trolls that it is about &ldquo;eliminating terrorists&rdquo; and not about &ldquo;'egos being given a reality check.&rdquo; He added that their &ldquo;Ostrich mentality' is 'laughable.&rdquo; Here’s his tweet.
Dear Pak trolls,
Its not about ur egos being given a reality check today; its about eliminating terrorists who u ‘claim’ r also ur enemies! Ur Ostrich mentality is laughable.Btw, ur abuses expose ur reality & therefore d only difference between u & a bucket of shit is the bucket! — Adnan Sami (@AdnanSamiLive) February 26, 2019
Sami had earlier on February 26 too hailed the IAF efforts and tweeted, &quot;The Force Is With You&quot; @narendramodi ji. Respect to @IAF_MCC .#HowsTheJosh #StopTerrorism #JaiHind .&quot;
Twelve days after the Pulwama terror attack, Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out major strikes at terror camps of Jaish-e-Mohammed in Balakot dropping 1,000kg bombs, which killed up to 350 terrorists, reportedly.
