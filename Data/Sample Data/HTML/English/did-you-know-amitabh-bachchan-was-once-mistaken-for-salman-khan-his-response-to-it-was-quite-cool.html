Did You Know Amitabh Bachchan Was Once Mistaken For Salman Khan? His Response To It Was Quite Cool!
Have you ever been mistaken for somebody else? For us, it might be a usual thing. But can you imagine celebrities being in a situation where they are confused for other stars?
In the west, it has happened quite a lot of times. For instance, once a fan asked This Is Us star Justin Hartley about his wife Blake. If you didn’t get the drift, he was mistaken for Ryan Reynolds. Can you imagine?
Recently, Amitabh Bachchan also revealed about one such incident that happened with him. Big B was once confused as Salman Khan. I know, even I want to know who that person was?
&ldquo;We were shooting on the streets in Glasgow and then I had to walk on the footpath. As I was walking, a car went by and our desi bhai was sitting in the car, who waved and said: 'Hey, Salman Khan, how you doing?' So, I waved back at him and walked on. What to do,&quot; the Badla actor told Shah Rukh Khan,&rdquo; Amitabh Bachchan recently revealed once again at the promotions of Badla.
