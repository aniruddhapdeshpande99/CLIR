&ldquo;In my case, the quickest way of forgetting about the fact that you were being watched was to get very drunk. Then as you get very drunk, you become aware that, ‘Oh, people are watching more now because now I’m getting very drunk, so I should probably drink more to ignore that more.&quot;

It took the actor &ldquo;a few years and a couple of attempts&rdquo; to quit alcohol. He said he has been sober since 2010.
