It isn't too difficult to decipher that the actor we are referring to here is Alia Bhatt.
She was targeted for nepotism when she entered and made her debut with Karan Johar's Student Of The Year but with her sheer hard-work and diverse choice of films, she proved that she was born to act!
While she is basking in the success of her last release Gully Boy, she has already been roped in to play world’s first woman amputee-mountaineer Arunima Sinha in her upcoming biopic.
A Peeping Moon report claims that Alia has already given her official nod for the film that will be based on Arunima’s book Born Again On The Mountain: A Story of Losing Everything And Finding It Back.
Who is Arunima?
She is the first female amputee to scale Mount Everest and Mount Vinson. She turned one of the biggest tragedies of her life into an opportunity to scale great heights. Arunima was a national level volleyball player who was struggling and fighting with a gang of robbers, who in turn pushed her from a running train in 2011.

As a result, one of her legs had to be amputated below the knee.
But she still managed to climb all the continents' highest peaks and hoist the national flag of India. She has already done six peaks by 2014: Everest in Asia, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Kosciuszko in Australia, Aconcagua in Argentina and Carstensz Pyramid (Puncak Jaya) in Indonesia. She completed her final summit of Mount Vinson in Antarctica on 4 January 2019.
The report quotes a source as saying,
&ldquo;Arunima’s life has been an inspiration to many across the globe and what she has managed isn’t just an ordinary feat. When makers approached her to make a film on her and told her they were planning to get Alia on board, she was excited.&rdquo;
The source adds that Alia is yet to lock the dates because of her packed schedule but she will soon be finalizing the dates, which most likely will be after the shoot of Takht next year.
After Kalank, Brahmastra and Takht, this might be yet another Dharma Productions film where Alia will be seen headlining the project.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
