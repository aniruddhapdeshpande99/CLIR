Just to jog you through, Sidhu ran into a controversy after he said on the The Kapil Sharma Show that an entire nation (Pakistan) and its people should not be blamed for the deeds of a few men while commenting on the February 14 attack in Pulwama, that killed at least 40 CRPF jawans.
Since there, there has been hashtags including #SackSidhu, #BoycottKapilSharmaShow and #UnsubscribeSontyTV doing rounds on Twitter. After Sidhu was fired, Archana Puran Singh replaced him on the show.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
