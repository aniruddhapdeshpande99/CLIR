The original schedule of the film was delayed because of Irrfan's treatment in the US. Talking to Deccan Chronicle, Tigmanshu said,
&ldquo;I did meet him after he returned to India. He is perfectly fine now. Irrfan told me that he will begin shooting for Hindi Medium franchise soon. We will do a film soon. Actually, we were in the process of writing one for him. Probably, if everything goes well, we shall be making the film soon.&quot;
There were several reports that hinted at the fact that to ensure recovery, Irrfan wouldn't work for at least a year.
