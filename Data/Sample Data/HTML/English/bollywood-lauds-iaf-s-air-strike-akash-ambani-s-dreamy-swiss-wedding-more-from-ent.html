Billy Porter might have worn the Tux-Gown but it was our homeboy Ranveer Singh who introduced this trend. Yes, it was Singh who started this fad of wearing a skirt under a jacket. It was during the promotions of his period drama Bajirao Mastani in 2015, that he started wearing skirts.
According to reports by several wedding portals, multiple venues have been booked to accomodate 300 plus guests. Hotels that have been booked are: Badrutt’s Palace Hotel, Kulm Hotel St. Moritz and Grand Hôtel des Bains. To accommodate and welcome their friends from the film industry and other close friends and relatives, Mukesh Ambani had reportedly booked uber-luxurious private jets. The guests were flown down directly to the Alpine resort.
As per reports, IAF used 12 Mirage 2000 fighter jets in the operation, which bombed regions like Balakot, Muzaffarabad, Chakothi at around 3:30 am today. The mission was a success as it managed to destroy three alpha control rooms and several terrorist lauchpads across the LOC.
