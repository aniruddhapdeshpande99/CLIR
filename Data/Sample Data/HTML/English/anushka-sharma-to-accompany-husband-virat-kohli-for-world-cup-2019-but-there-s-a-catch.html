She's one of the few actresses who has beautifully managed work and life. Whether it was the England series, or the matches in New Zealand or celebrating Valentine's Day in Virat's restaurant in New Delhi, she has stood by her husband and it's an impressive move for an A-lister top actress.
As per reports, she will also be accompanying husband for the World Cup tour 2019. Anushka, who has no movies in her kitty, will be spending her summers in England but there is a twist.
Unlike, previous times when she has toured with Virat, this time she will be paying for her trip. According to reports, the actress will go to stadiums separately. The actress will also hire her own car. She will also bear all her expenses.

&quot;The wives of the Indian cricketers have discussed the huge media attention that is bound to be there for the World Cup and both want to keep all distractions at bay during the World Cup, which Virat definitely wants to try and win for India. Both feel the lesser the distraction on match days, the more the mind will only focus on the match, a source close to the development told an entertainment website.
