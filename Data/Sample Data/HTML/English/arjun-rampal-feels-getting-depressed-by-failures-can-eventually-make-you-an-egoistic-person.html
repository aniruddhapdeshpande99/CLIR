Arjun Rampal dressed in a casual shirt and a hoodie and tracks spoke to us in his colorful office filled with interesting choice of paintings. The actor looked a tad bit tired as he has been busy promoting his first web series The Final Call. His character is extremely mysterious in the show but in reality, we must tell you, he is completely opposite.

Despite having seen failures in his life, Arjun is happy he made it to Hindi Cinema and feels Bollywood is an amazing world to live in. He further adds that the best way to survive here is to be true to what you do and keep your mind open and be able to explore that with honesty and we agree.

Looking at his Bollywood career graph, one can say that Arjun has seen more failures than success but he has no regrets about it,
&ldquo;I look at it like a marriage where there is success and failure, actually success and failure are like husband and wife, they compliment each other, without failure you cannot have success. You can only be successful once you have seen the failure and value that. Is failure a bad thing to happen? No, it’s a stepping stone, it's something which you learn from, if you are going to get depressed by failure means you are an egoistic person and you are going down a route of self-destruction.&rdquo;

There are lots of films which have worked tremendously well at the box office but they had no content, Arjun amusingly says, he fails to understand how sometimes a good film doesn’t work and bad films become successful. Arjun looked a bit bogged down with the failures he has seen, but that only makes him stronger.
Being in the industry for more than a decade, the actor is still clueless on what will impress and depress the audiences, but all he can do is choose his scripts wisely and continue to work hard.

Arjun even admitted that he wants more and more adulation and fan followings and for that, he has been working harder than ever,
&ldquo;Of course, you want more and more fan following, you want the adulation, that's like the drug you have, that's the high, it gives you of saying wow. When it comes to me, I'm terrible at communicating with my fans and social media, but I am good with my work, so I have maintained through the body of my work and I really work very hard on that it's not like I got it overnight or it's a fluke. But to be scared and fearful is a negative feeling, if you overcome fear you reach freedom.&rdquo;

More power to Arjun Rampal for his never giving up attitude and here's hoping we get to see more of him on silver screen.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
