&quot;My first thought was to hide it because it was a disease. I thought my ‘brand’ is over—all along I had been endorsing healthy eating and health-focused products, and suddenly it was all gone. It was only when my oncologist said that I had fourth-stage cancer and a 30 percent chance that my whole world view changed. Suddenly I didn’t see any reason not to talk about it. I had done nothing wrong; it was not my fault I had cancer, so why was I hiding it?&rdquo;
Sonali believes in embracing all her scars and for her, cancer never meant hating her body. She said,
&ldquo;I have a more loving relationship with my body for what it has gone through. I started thanking it for what it was doing… how it was healing itself and taking me forward. I’m more comfortable with my body now and I don’t want to unnecessarily stress it or have unrealistic goals. I’m okay with some saggy, loose bits here, some cellulite there. I don’t find it ugly anymore. In fact, I find it beautiful and I don’t know when that shift happened.&rdquo;
That's not all. She shot for the same magazine and embracing all her flaws and scars, she also flaunted her 20 inch surgery scar. Have a look at the pictures.
