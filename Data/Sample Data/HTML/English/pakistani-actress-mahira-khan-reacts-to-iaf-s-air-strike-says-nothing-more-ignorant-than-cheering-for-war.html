&ldquo;Nothing uglier. Nothing more ignorant than cheering for war. May sense prevail... Pakistan zindabad,&rdquo; she wrote.
Another Pakistani actress Mawra Hocane, who was seen in Indian film Sanam Teri Kasam, feels it is time to put humanity first.
&quot;It is time we understand this as humans. The media needs to take charge and stop being provocative. It's our duty to inculcate peace and use our words for better and not worse. Praying for peace always,&quot; she posted.
&ldquo;There can be NO winners in war if we value Human Life at all.&ldquo;

Actor Fahad Mustafa also hoped for peace, and said, &quot;War does not determine who is right ...Only who is left. Say no to war.&quot;

While many wished for peace, there were some stars who reacted strongly. Actor Hamza Ali Abbasi posted, &quot;Balakot, well done India. Much improvement from the fake Surgical Strike claim. This time yes IAF aircraft crossed LOC 4 to 6 miles at 2.55 a.m. and had to retreat at 2.59 a.m. due to PAF (Pakistan Air Force) scrambling, dropping the load on the way martyring our trees. But now, Pakistan must retaliate.&quot;
