Instead of shying away from the media, both Farhan and Shibani are very comfortable in posing for media and they made an official confirmation on the same when they arrived at DeepVeer reception in Mumbai holding hands.
Wedding bells?
Reports have time and again hinted at the very fact that the couple has decided to take the plunge and seal the deal with a private wedding ceremony in the first quarter of the year. Their friends spoke to media on the condition of anonymity and told DNA,
&quot;They are extremely serious about each other and Farhan's kids have also warmed up to Shibani, so this looks like the most obvious step for the two.&quot;
On Valentine's Day, Farhan Akhtar dedicated a sweet post for Shibani. He wrote:
&quot;I don't know if you find love or love finds you, either way, it's a gift from the universe. So be grateful. Every. Single. Day&quot;
The couple is currently in Mexico on a vacay. Here are a few pictures that show how they are making the most of their time together.</p><a href='../../../Output/output.html'> Back to Output page </a> </body></html>
